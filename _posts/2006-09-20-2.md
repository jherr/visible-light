Megan brought home a cold the first week of school.  She had a stuffy nose for a day and 2 nights.  The second day she woke up feeling fine.  2 days later I had a scratchy throat.  Now i&apos;m stuffed up and starting to sound a bit Tenor.  

Didn&apos;t stop me from taking a class tonight on Beading Earrings.  Really enjoyed myself.  I made 4 pairs and really just plowed through finishing in the 3 hours, while everyone else in class managed one of each pair- with homework.  not that I have time to really get into Beading right now - but i know how to know when I do have time.
