Megan has been up now for over an hour.  She woke up screaming and I looked at the clock and though it was after 6, so I let her get up and we cuddled, she followed me to the bathroom and then we went back to bed and talked for 30 mins or so, then I realized it was really only 3 so I told her we had to go back to sleep, she said &quot;NO&quot;  So I put her back in the crib and tried laying in bed - but her being able to see me meant she screamed very loudly.  So I got a pillow and went out to the couch - The suites in Embassy Suites means we have 2 rooms.  She&apos;s now crying every few minutes.  She not sick, we&apos;re both just tired.  So .... my apologies to the people in rooms 146 and 148 but I need to let her just have it out, or we&apos;re never going to go back to sleep.
