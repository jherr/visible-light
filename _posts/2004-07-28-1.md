My sister was telling me Kerry flipped someone off and it was on tv.  I couldn&apos;t believe it so I spent some time this evening researching it.  The only &quot;news&quot; source I could find was NewsMax which says &quot;NewsMax is already the leading conservative news site on the web&quot;  There is no photographic evidence and it wasn&apos;t picked up by any mainstream media (though she thinks she saw it on a mainstream news show).  So you have Cheney who needs his mouth washed out with Soap who tells congress off on C-Span and you have Kerry who may or may not have flipped a guy off named Ted Sampley as he reported it to &quot;NewsMax&quot; and he has a track record as a Kerry hater.  No one else appears to have come forward.  Which would you be more offended by?
