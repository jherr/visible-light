So Megan&apos;s favorite computer activity as previously reported is to use the Google image search and pull up pictures of fish, turtles etc.  She come up to us on our lap top and says &quot;google Fish&quot; etc

Yesterday we Googled  [Pig...](http://images.google.com/images?q=pig&hl=en&lr=&sa=N&tab=wi)  who would have thought it but Googling Pig turned out to be x rated.  ok maybe R but still not Megan appropriate.

All the others in safe mode are completely safe for small children.
