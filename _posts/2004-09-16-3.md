Our spa broke down a few weeks back.  The guy who sold it to us went on vacation, so when he finally came back earlier this week I got ahold of him.  He told me his repair guy would be out here either thursday or friday - a 2 DAY WINDOW!.  So I called the mom  and friend Megan and i were going to play with and invited them over to wait with us.  She brought over eggplant and fixings for Eggplant parmesan, Stefan and Megan and another friend Stephanie, played in the morning - then while lunch was cooking Stefan and Megan moved out back and played in the sprinkler.  (Stephanie went home with her mom to nap).  We had a delicious lunch and  then the kids watched an animal video Stefan brought, while I cleaned up.   Megan went down for nap and our friends went home.  The spa man called to say his repair man would be out first thing in the morning  - go figure.  Still it was a lovely day.
