I called the local police department today.  I was driving down a road over the highway when I stopped at a red light so that people coming off the freeway could turn onto the road I was on.  A woman just sat there while all the other cars honked and then went around her.  Once the light changed and it was clear she proceeded to back up down the off ramp I guess to get on the freeway.  I watched in disbelief as my light turned green and grabbed my cell phone.  I have no idea if they reached her before she made it back on the freeway, but I did chuckle when the local police dispatch said &quot;why didn&apos;t you just call 911 - its the CHP&apos;s job to handle that not ours.&quot;  - you see i had thought to call our local police force since all 911 cell phone calls get routed to Sacramento&apos;s CHP office a good 2 hour drive away. Next time I see an idiot reversing an off ramp - i&apos;ll know better :)
