Megan is working on her 3rd sniffly cough since starting kindergarten.  Its amazing that its only the beginning of November!  She hasn&apos;t missed any school because so far - knock knock - no fever associated with any of these colds.

I&apos;m doing better with my foot- I&apos;m still mostly wear the boot out and about but am trying the shoe around the house.  Seriously though there isn&apos;t much to the shoe it just won&apos;t let me flex my foot.  My therapist recommended getting an ankle wrap to wear with it and to just carry the boot in the car - maybe then i&apos;ll be more willing to try.  i have until tuesday next week before I see him again so that&apos;s almost a whole week to get walking.  Physical therapy is exhausting.  The days I finish it I&apos;m ready to just crash after.  Today was particularly grueling because I had a filling fixed (loose childhood metal filling) before and had to contend with drool and all that.  I managed most of the exercises with little trouble, and the stim machine - the electrodes they place on your injury while icing or heating- well I can feel them - which I couldn&apos;t in the beginning so I figure that means blood flow has picked up and nerve endings are waking.
