A typical florida storm is going on right now - the lighting and loud thunder - rain  by the buckets - the type of storm we don&apos;t get often in California - maybe once in the last 8 years.  Storms like this I miss.  I love our life in California but 9 months of sunshine and perfect weather can really get to you.

So now I just want to put it out there - though I do have a living will that I made out when my mom died.  Jack is my husband, and he shall make any and all decisions for me if I become unable to do so myself.  I do not want to live with tubes and machines , If something happens I want to go and be let go.  No fights no anger. - The government needs to respect our wishes and stop getting into our lives.  
end of 2 cents.
