I would expect better than  [this](http://static.vidvote.com/movies/bushuncensored.mov)  from our commander and chief.  He&apos;s showing his true self in this video.

UPDATE
I didn&apos;t remember that Jack had already blogged about this.  I knew I had seen it before when I stumbled across it on a third party site. So you may have already sat through the video of Bush shooting a bird for the camera.
