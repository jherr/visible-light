Its been a month since we got the elliptical trainer.  Except for the period in the middle that I was sick, I&apos;ve been using it for 20 minutes 3 days on and 1 day off.  I&apos;ve changed it up a bit and am now doing 2 days on 1 day off, cause that 3rd day was a killer.  But overall I&apos;m feeling incredible.  I absolutely loath the whole exercise thing, but I appreciate the need for it.  It also helps that  [GH](http://abc.go.com/daytime/generalhospital/index.html)  has resurrected Robert Scorpio.  It really gives me something to sink my mind into while i&apos;m working up a sweat.

I  wanted to get healthier for myself and for Megan and Jack.  And the walk from the garage to the shower is really one i&apos;ve never felt before, the sense of accomplishment is wonderful.  The when Megan and I started dancing to ABBA I didn&apos;t have to stop after one song.. .we just kept going, me holding her and both of us dancing and laughing.  It felt wonderful.
