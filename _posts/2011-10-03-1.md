Last week we had summer, today fall is rolling in with rain and cool down.   Beef stew for dinner tonight. More like Beef Burgundy the way I like to make it.  

train of thought lost because a telemarketer wanted me to subscribe to TV guide.  Ugh.

Still have the quilting to do - and now I need to make the halloween wall hanging I bought supplies for.  but today I&apos;m going to finish the second tombstone for the front yard - must get the house spooky for the month.  So much to do this month.

Bought a carpet cleaner - might love it more than the 16 foot extension duster - not sure that is even possible.

I&apos;ve been a bit moody of late - 

Someone actually told me last week that children of single child homes can&apos;t interact well with others and are not socialized well. This person went on and on about it.   Not that I believe any of the crap said, but I can not believe the audacity and rudeness and just plain ignorance.   Wish now I&apos;d told the person off, but I bit my tongue and now I&apos;m stewing about it.  Full circle - back to stew!

Here&apos;s a pic of my wonderful girl and me camping a in August  - we had a great time.
