Megan was such a happy girl today.  She may have missed out on her wonderful Cake that Daddy made her but she enjoyed herself and her party immensely.  It was such a delight to watch her run around and realize that all her friends were there for her!  Have the party at the gym was great.  Megan really loves it there and you could tell she was having a blast.  

Megan calls all cake &quot;Happy&quot;  I thought it was cause we usually eat cake at birthday&apos;s but now I think it just makes her happy!  In total we had 12 kids and their folks.  150+ pictures were taken on our camera and some video of the cake blowing part.

I can&apos;t believe my baby is 2.  Or will be monday :)
