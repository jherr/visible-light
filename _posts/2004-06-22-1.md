It&apos;s 3 am and I can&apos;t sleep.  I got up to watch tv but am instead mindlessly surfing.  The trouble is a popping sensation I&apos;ve been having in my lower left side of my belly.  So of course I&apos;ve been doing the &quot;diagnosis&quot; myself route on the internet.  I think I&apos;m just going to have to call tomorrow and make an appointment with my dr to check it out.

If anyone has any ideas what it could be let me know - Its not painful, and while it feels like gas bubbles popping, I don&apos;t seem to actually have gas.  It seems to almost always be there, but I really feel it more when I relax and am not thinking about anything else. 

Gonna try to get some sleep now,  Nothing but news and infomercials seem to be on right now.
