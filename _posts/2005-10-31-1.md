Megan and Jack are out trick or treating, and its 7:20 and I&apos;m almost out of candy - 3 big bags passed out.  I raided the pantry and am now giving out fruit snacks.
 
We&apos;ve never had so many trick or treaters and so many unique costumes.  I went with Megan to her first house and she ran up to the door, knocked and then ran back to us.  Jack had to walk her to the house - she didn&apos;t get it at first but she did by the end, and now she&apos;s having a blast :)
