Well this year is off to better start.  I didn&apos;t start out today in the hospital recovering from surgery like I did last year and today I didn&apos;t have any more mishaps like yesterday.  I&apos;m thinking the 3rd thing from yesterday was I destroyed the rug from our bathroom.  I threw it in the wash ( and it disintegrated) before I smashed the baking dish or ran into Jack&apos;s car so it was actually the first of 3 bad things.  I just didn&apos;t find it till later cause  I was alittle distracted. 

Today Jack and Megan played at Gymboree while I ran down to Target and bought a new bath matt.  Then we had lunch at this great new sushi place in Fremont.  I then headed to a movie (girl with a pearl earring - which I recommend to any one who likes character films, or period pieces- and of course it had my man Mr Firth so it was great!) while Megan napped and Jack did some work.  It was a great day and then it was topped off by excellent football.  It was a bit of a nail-bitter but the Canes prevailed.  

Now lets see if Miami is finally placed above FSU in the damn polls!
