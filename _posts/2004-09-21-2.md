after 4 days of no nursing Megan decided she wanted to nurse today.  I let her and she happily sucked for about 5 mins.  I can&apos;t believe I had milk for her but sure enough when she pulled off she had the tell tale white drool.  I reflected while she nursed on how wonderful it felt and how it maybe the last time.  She was bored.  We&apos;d been waiting in a little room for the doctor for over 40 mins and she had done everything she could think of 10 times.  We have all had our flu shots now, even Jack.
