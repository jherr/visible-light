I got my sorry butt out of bed this morning at 6:15 and went to the pool to swim laps.  I&apos;ve been averaging 3 trips to the pool a week, 2 during Megan&apos;s school and once on the weekend.  That along with the elliptical trainer and a workout video i&apos;m into and well i&apos;m feeling better than I have in years. But now that Megan&apos;s school is out for the summer finding time to do laps is difficult. 

 I saw that I could go between 6 and 9 and Jack agreed to work from home until I got back at 8.  It really worked out beautifully for about 45 minutes and then the pool was inundated with a bunch of slower swimmers and I started having to swim slow to keep from running over this older gentleman.  Long story short- i cut my work out down 15 minutes but it still felt good. 

The only trouble is i&apos;m not a morning person.  I&apos;m a late night person.  I&apos;m usually up till midnight on my laptop so i&apos;m not sure I can last all summer getting up that early to swim laps.  For now i&apos;ll try to go one time during the week and then later on saturday, and If I can manage a third day all the better.  But by the end of summer I will be looking forward to Megan&apos;s return to school (3 mornings a week!)
