I&apos;m doing what I thought I&apos;d never do, bribing my daughter to use the potty with .... [m & ms](http://www.mms.com/) .  Megan couldn&apos;t be happier to poop on the potty, which until I started this trickery wasn&apos;t happening except by accident.  I&apos;m sure your wondering - she gets 4 M&M&apos;s for every poop in the potty, and 10 for going a whole day with out going in the pullup.  There are occasional side offers, like tonight after she got her first 4 I told her if she didn&apos;t pee in the pullup from now till bath time she&apos;d get 4 more.

We might even in a week try a day in underwear, but i&apos;m not pushing it.
