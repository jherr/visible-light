I bought a water proof camera (up to 17 ft) at Wally World today for 7 bucks.  Now I can take pictures of Megan at the pool and not worry about it getting wet.    I played with it this afternoon and took a few shots of Megan this evening when we went swimming after dinner.  The instant gratification of digital photography is wonderful and its hard to go back to waiting till the roll is used and then getting it all developed.

Speaking of Wally World (Walmart for you non Cutherell types), I usually don&apos;t shop there cause the one in Union City is a mess, but this one is pretty organized and gave me and Megan a quick outing.  I noticed that it seemed to be the place to go to here in Ocala, with the family on the weekend.  I mean this place was packed with people.  It made for interesting people watching.
