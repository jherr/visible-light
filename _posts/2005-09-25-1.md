We&apos;ve had a house guest since the bitch &quot;Rita&quot; decided to take aim at Houston and all points east.  Its been great to spend time with my brother Michael, though the first 2 days he was understandably stressed about being here while his family was in Texas.  Once Saturday morning broke and it was clear that Katy was safe from Rita, we had a lovely visit.  Yesterday we hung out with Pam and Yvonne and did the  [Corn Maze](http://www.cornfieldmaze.com/sites.php?ID=&username=cafremont) , then came back to the house and cooked a great big pasta feast.  

Today we took Megan to  [Flight Plan](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/flightplan/) .  Tomorrow Michael finally gets to go home which he is anxious to do.

So we get back from the movie and Megan is still up.  While Jack took the sitter home, I put Megan to bed.  She had been watching  [Toy Story 2](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/toy_story_2/)  and it was past her bed time so I said &quot;bedtime&quot; implying no books tonight.  She said &quot;mommy read books&quot;.... I looked at her beautiful face and said, &quot;ok but just one&quot;  

&quot;three&quot; she replied holding up 3 fingers..... &quot;No one&quot; I assured her..... &quot;two&quot; she questioned holding up the sign for peace.... how could I refuse.  We headed to her room where she dutifully picked out only one book.  It was short and she was so lively that I relented and let her pick out another book.  

Ok I know ... I was the manipulatee and not the manipulator :)
