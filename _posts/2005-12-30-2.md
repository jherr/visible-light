Tonight as I was cuddling with Megan, she commented on how my boobs made her milk and asked if they would make more milk?  I told her yes, if we had another baby they would.  She looked at me and said that was good and that she&apos;d like a sister.   

I chuckled and said I would tell her dad all about it... and she replied

&quot;no not daddy, tell Santa&quot;
