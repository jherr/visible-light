its totally my own fault.  I stayed up till 4 in the morning organizing our taxes.  Its April 7th, i&apos;ve officially waited until the last minute!

To be fair to myself - I&apos;d meant to spend this whole weekend doing them - I had carved out the days and everything and then Saturday morning I woke up with a fever, that really lasted through yesterday leaving me feeling week and pathetic.  Now I&apos;m stuffy and have a killer headache.  Since I rested while sick I had to  do our tax prep last night - you see my appointment with our tax appointment is in 30 mins.  I made it a month ago and I waited until last night to get organized and figure it all out.

I will do better next year - I better.
