As Megan and Oso play a game of chase me I have your toy, I&apos;m reminded of just how lucky we are.  How incredibly fortunate we&apos;ve been ...

and how cruel toddlers can be to unsuspecting dogs (she just put his ball in her crib).

I&apos;m the lucky one, Megan is a wonderful daughter (and very clever toddler), and Jack is the best of husbands.
