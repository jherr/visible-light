I had a little dental work done.  Last week at my semi-anual cleaning, my dentist diagnosed a cracked molar (which had been causing me minor dull pain for a while) and  also agreed to file down a small chip on my front tooth.  So yesterday I spent about an hour in the dentists office while this was all fixed.  

Last night it was like they didn&apos;t sit together right anymore, and I wasn&apos;t coming over Novocain since she didn&apos;t use any. She had assured me she wouldn&apos;t drill near the nerve and it never hurt, just felt strange... anyway back to point... my teeth just don&apos;t feel like my own anymore.  THe chip in the front is now gone but my bottom tooth doesn&apos;t rest right with my top tooth... in stead of enjoying the fixed crack (and lack of pain in my jaw for a change) I&apos;m fixated on opening and closing my mouth just to see how its lining up and why it feels so darn strange.  Its like she did more than just fix these 2 small problems - its like she put in new teeth all together.

Just how long does it take for once mouth to feel right again?
