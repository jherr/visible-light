This  [ad from the United Church of Christ](http://www.stillspeaking.com/default.htm)  gave me chills.  Jesus taught tolerance and acceptance.  If I were to ever go back to a church, one that was open minded would be more to my taste.  I always thought that would be the Unitarian Church, but now I see there are other open and loving groups out there.
