Big most of my life, my size has been an issue for me off and on in the past, but I&apos;ve been comfortable in my own skin for the last 10 years or so.    Sure I&apos;d love to continue to get healthy, but I really stopped beating myself up for  being fat and have just worked on enjoying life.  This after years of feeling awful for my weight and being so down on myself.  From being a closet eater in highschool and then an overeater in college, I finally found peace with it all while we were living overseas.  (ok this is alot more simplistic than the actual story but you get the idea.)  But when the CDC comes out and says Obesity is the number 2 killer yada yada yada, suddenly i&apos;m thinking about it again - more than I&apos;d like but I can&apos;t seem to stop...

well.... [The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated today that packing on too many pounds accounts for 25,814 deaths a year in the United States. As recently as January, the CDC came up with an estimate 14 times higher: 365,000 deaths.](http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/nation/3142605)  14 TIMES HIGHER THAN REALITY, Instead of being just behind cigarettes as the number 2 killer of us, its in reality number 7 behind car accidents and guns.
