Hailey Michele was born this morning to my brother David and his wife Michelle.  With the birth of Elizabeth Michele on Feb 2 to my bother Mike and his Partner Missy, that makes a total of 5 grand daughters that have mom&apos;s name as a middle name.  Mom would be so proud. 

Congratulations to the whole Cutherell Clan on its continued growth. Speedy recovery to Michelle and Speedy homecoming to Hailey.
