I&apos;ve been feeling so drained lately.  and haven&apos;t felt much like blogging.

Last night I saw &quot;Monster In Law&quot; which wasn&apos;t the highlight of the evening.  It was cute but by no means a great movie, I did enjoy dinner though.  My friend and I tried a new restaurant last night in Fremont...
  [Mirchi Cafe](http://www.mirchicafe.com/) , which an article in a local paper described as confusion cooking, instead of fusion.  It was delicious.  Indian spices in traditionally Italian dishes.  Such a new and tasty.
