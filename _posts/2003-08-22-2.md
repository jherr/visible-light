I had the realization today that I&apos;m healthy.  After nine months of morning sickness and who knows how long sick with gall stones,  I think I just continued to act like I was sick - taking it easy on myself.   I&apos;m feeling better than I have in years.  I have energy to do what ever I set my mind to.  This week I&apos;ve cleaned out the pantry, rearranged Megan&apos;s room, rearranged the dining room, took Megan swimming, gymboree,  playgroup and the mall, went on daily walks including a 2 mile walk today to a new playground that Megan loved, and tonight while Jack bathed Megan I washed my car.  I&apos;m really loving this!   Mind you I still have some aches and pains but I think that is from being so out of shape, I&apos;m sure that will approve in time.
