Megan and I are still out of it.   It has been nice to get outside and bake a little.  Today we soaked in the spa while getting some sun.  Its so warm and nice that its too bad we can&apos;t really go anywhere but I feel so drained that i&apos;m not even going to make it to my tuesday night out with mom friends.

we&apos;ve just been watching movies and playing with the v-tech.  Yesterday afternoon we even went for a walk since the weather is just so wonderful finally.  We&apos;ll do the same today after nap time.  Megan&apos;s down now and i&apos;m very soon to follow.
