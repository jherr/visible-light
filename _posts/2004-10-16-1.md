It was delicious.  I really really enjoyed every morsel.  And I ended with a lovely strong and sweet coffee that was heaven.  And then I went home and tried to sleep.  Usually we eat dinner at 6.  Last night the shower wasn&apos;t even until 7.  By the time everyone arrived and we ordered food it was close to 8.  It was all wonderful, but I felt so full and the caffeine made me so wired I couldn&apos;t sleep... I finally drifted off around 1:30 and that&apos;s when Megan woke up with her fever spiking.  The amazing thing is I&apos;m awake now - its only 7:30 and I&apos;m wide awake.
