I just realized I never blogged yesterday - our last day in Sadona.  We started the day with a hike - surprise surprise!  We did one called  [soldiers pass to Brin&apos;s Mesa](http://www.greatsedonahikes.com/Brins_Soldier/brinssold.html) .  It was the hardest hike yet and Jack, Megan and myself were just dragging.  After about an hour and half of mostly uphill hiking, The Bolducs went on ahead and we turned around and took our time going back, opting for the 4 wheel drive trail over the hikers one.  It proved to be much easier than the foot trail.  

We met back at the car and headed back to town.  The kids and I swam, Jen and Thom did another hike behind the hotel, and Jack took a much needed nap.  We headed back out and went to main street to do a bit of souvenir shopping, before Jack, Jen and I headed over to  [cantina for dinner. Which proved passable fair.  ](http://www.javelinacantina.com/ ) 

Today we woke up and packed up and headed out, but before we left Sedona we went to  [Palatiki Ruins](http://www.fs.fed.us/r3/coconino/recreation/red_rock/palatki-ruins.shtml)  which proved interesting and a nice hike up to 2 parts of the ruins - one to look at actual structures and one to look at art painted on cave walls. Both were fascinating.  

We left Sedona and headed to Flagstaff where we went to  [Museum of Northern Arizona](http://www.musnaz.org)  and then we drove on to our hotel just outside of the south rim of the Grand Canyon.  We had time before dinner to walk down to the IMAX experience of the Grand Canyon  and then back to the hotel for dinner, laundry and bed. 

Tomorrow we are planning on bussing into the Village, and then taking a hike along the crest ridge.  We&apos;ll do lunch and then hike the other side from the village using the shuttle to supplement our going.    We&apos;ll see how much we get done and on friday we&apos;ll be able to explore other trails that we want to see.
