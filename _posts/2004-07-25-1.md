Jack has done a marvelous job with  [Kotobuki](http://www.sushi.infogate.de/rest/na_usa_florida_ocala.htm) , quick trip to Target for diapers, and then home and Megan and I visted with Dad&apos;s neighbors.  She was so tired that when I started singing our song after we brushed teeth, she just pointed to her bed and went straight down.

Tomorrow we&apos;re going to sleep in and meet grandpa for lunch at the hospital where he volunteers every monday morning.
