So i&apos;m currently using my old laptop which  was replaced because the monitor would go out and the whole thing would need a good shake to come back on.  It seemed to be getting worse yesterday but i&apos;ve managed 20 whole minutes without even a dimming monitor - makes me want to stay on all day :)

of course as soon as I move it I&apos;m sure it will die.  Oh apple hurry up and send me back my machine!
