The 4th is 2 nights away  - its not tonight, its not tomorrow - its in 2 nights and yet they insist on setting off their damn firecrackers now.  and so I have to run the a/c to block out the noise - and give poor Oso who is beside himself some valium.  We&apos;ll likely have to drug him all weekend.
