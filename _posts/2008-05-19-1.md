I get that a mortgage crises was a major contributor to the current state of the economy but honestly I had no idea - I really didn&apos;t understand sub prime or why banks loaned money to people who couldn&apos;t afford it.  Coming back from film club and while cooking dinner earlier I listened to  [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=1242)   from May 9th titled Giant Pool of Money - and I now have a much better sense in what developed, and am infuriated that it was allowed to. It is a fascinating listen.
