For about a week, we&apos;ve had a brown spider living in our bathroom.   He&apos;s about the size of a quarter with his body the size of a dime,  I&apos;ve tried repeatedly to catch him, but he seems to know where to scurry off too quickly and proved elusive.  

So yesterday Megan and Jack were off to the beach with Oso and I went in to take a shower - there he was in the bathtub.  Since he was contained I figured it was my best chance.  I grabbed a cup and trapped him and then slid a piece of paper under him.  I had a moment of freak out when I realized the paper drooped alittle and I dropped him back in the tub, but he seemed fine and I recaptured him, folding the paper in half to get rid of the excess.  

I carried him out side opened the sliding the door and tossed him low to the ground - Duncan heard the commotion from where he was outside and came running over to me.  As he came up he STEPPED on the poor spider!

All of this didn&apos;t kill the poor guy as he started moving a bit a few second later, but unfortunately Duncan suddenly noticed him ...

and ate him!
