Late yesterday afternoon I lost Jack - he was there and then he wasn&apos;t and I couldn&apos;t figure out where he had gone.  I knew he&apos;d wanted to go for a run but it was still too hot.  So I looked around for him, including going into Guest Room to look out the window to see if his truck was in the drive way.  Turns out he was taking a nap.  

Later that evening, we were eating dinner on the patio with Little Guy doing his usual begging.  But he was alone.  We commented on how Mimi was missing out and we just would sneak him some treats since he usually doesn&apos;t get a break from her.

THen Jack fed the dogs, put down 3 bowls and all 3 were emptied. 

Megan went to bed and wanted Little Guy to sleep with her so we shut her door on him.   A while later I was in my office and I heard barking - figuring it was Little Guy fed up with being trapped, I headed up to free him, and as I passed the guest room door, heard whimpering.  Opening it I discovered Mimi.  

Later when I was sharing with Jack we realized just how long she had been missing and that the boys must have delighted in her absence and her dinner.

Brothers...<br />
