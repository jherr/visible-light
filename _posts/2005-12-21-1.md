 UPDATE  Found the link for  [Lestat](http://lestatmusical.com/) 

Jack and I went and saw Lestat last night, the Anne Rice Vampire novel put to music by Elton John and on stage.  It wasn&apos;t bad, and will be a pretty good show eventually, but it needs some work.  Turns out we were at the 3rd  performance of it, ever!, and they are still tweaking it.  I say cut out an entire character (Nicolas the violin player), cut out a couple of songs including Lestat on the boat which was just pretty pointless and made it too long.

They need to strengthen some characters a bit, Marius is important to the story but completely unbelievable as an ancient vampire.  He didn&apos;t have any sort of air of authority.  

It took the better of the first half, like 3 parts to turn Lestat into a vampire and that should be trimmed down, course if they cut out Nicolas they loose 3 scenes here - go from Lestat and his mother  to him going to paris to be an actor.

Oh and cut out some effects during the killing and converting to vampire scene, its just too much.

OK I know the production team isn&apos;t reading my blog, but they&apos;ve got an interesting and new premise here, and a couple of great songs (Claudia&apos;s I want more will probably be nominated for a tony), It&apos;ll be interesting to see how it evolves.  To goto it again in 5 years and see how it changed.
