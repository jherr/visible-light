Another day of volcanos.  We again started with Breakfast in camp, very enjoyable.  Headed out by 10.  First stop the  [Hat Creek Radio Observatory](http://www.hcro.org/)  where we got to see a bunch of radio telescopes move together and hear all about them from an intern (our own private tour guide).  The observatory is surround by Ranch land on one side and lava beds on the other - and then again surrounded by a ring of volcano mountains.  Its a joint project  operated as a partnership between the University of California Berkeley and the SETI Institute.

We then headed out and then stopped at Subway Lava Tube Cave.  We&apos;d forgotten our flashlights so the actual cave was out of the question but it did prove to be the perfect spot for a picnic lunch.

Back to Lassen in time for another Great Ranger talk - this one on mountain lions, and then Megan got her 3rd Jr Ranger this trip - not a badge this time but a patch and a certificate.

We&apos;ve decided to stay one extra night so we aren&apos;t pulling out of here until Wed.  So we needed another quick stop at a super market, and we then headed back to the KOA where we swam at the pool, made dinner and then shared our camp fire with some temporary neighbors. <br />
