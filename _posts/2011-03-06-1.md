I was really looking forward to the new house.  I now have a craft room office that isn&apos;t hidden and cold in the garage.  But I&apos;m overwhelmed by the amount of stuff I have and can&apos;t figure out who to make it all work.  Ah to have such problems.  

Jack and I are discussing him building me some shelves in an odd triangular corner.  And though I love having the printer and files for all the finances I think those are going to move up to Jack&apos;s office - he is only using his office as an office - while i&apos;ve got sewing, jewelry making and scrap booking on my agenda.

Maybe Megan&apos;s computer is going to move too.  - no idea where to though.  

Ideally I want my sewing machine out from the wall, and a table where I can sit and do projects - currently I&apos;m using the cutting table for that and its tall and means I stand.  

I&apos;ll post pics when I get it figured out.
