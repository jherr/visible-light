Well our wonderful weather continued.  It was in the 40&apos;s this am so I wasn&apos;t sure it would, but by the time i dropped Megan off at school I had shed a layer, by the time I got home it was time for shorts.  I think that is what inspired me to grill tonight.  After dinner we all went for a dip in the jacuzzi.  I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll cool off again tonight, but so far its slow going and a comfy 69 in the house with all the windows opened.

Tomorrow we&apos;re probably going to hit the zoo with playgroup.
