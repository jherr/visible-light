After a fairly uneventful stay at the hotel, Megan and  are ready to try again - well sort of -she still sleeping and i&apos;m not going to rush her til I need to - the longer she sleeps in the better for the time change.  

I did realize last night that I only brought 8 diapers which should be enough if I don&apos;t let Megan have any more TCBY!  I put the extra ones in the box that dad is sending us, stuff I didn&apos;t want to personally lug across country and am more than happy to let UPS do for me.  So everyone wish us luck and good thoughts as we attempt to get home today.

BTW for anyone traveling with a small child through Florida bear in mind that Tampa secerity brings you to the front of the line if you have a stroller. - big time saver!  Its because the switch backs are tight I think or some one here actually realized that making a nine month old stand in line for an hour is not a good idea for all involved.
