Mumsie, my dad&apos;s lovely wife, makes a really great poppy seed cake that people rave about.  When I had it I asked for the recipe and I&apos;ve been passing it off as my own here in California, and I get all the praise.

So cut to tonight .. I planned on making it for the Principal Coffee for tomorrow.  I bought the main ingredient, and after dinner tonight I went and printed up the copy of the recipe from my email.  Well poppy seed cake - you need poppy seeds, but I didn&apos;t have any so now I&apos;m making pound cake instead (same recipe no Poppy Seeds).  I start mixing together slowing going down the list ... eggs oil... etc.. when I get to sour cream.. Again - no sour cream... so what to do ... I substituted Buttermilk instead.  It smells great and it baked beautifully. 

I&apos;m just wondering when I get to really call the recipe as my own.  <br />
