Jack made me my own little space - for crafts and sewing and the like.  It allows me to work on things and be able to stop mid-project and not have to clean it all up.  I can just shut the door.  I can&apos;t tell you how excited I am by this.  Tonight I made Oso a Xmas scarf for his collar - you know with a loop so that its his collar actually goes through it and it just looks like he&apos;s wearing a scarf.  

I need to hang a few pictures and get some organization going for everything I do - but wow - its so cool having a space like this!
