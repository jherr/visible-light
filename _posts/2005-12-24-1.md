Jack and Megan are off on a treasure hunt, and I&apos;ve spent the time, cleaning (I had to unplug the dyson again - its astounding what that sucker will pick up.  The roller brush was a tangle of fabric sheets and a couple of Megan&apos;s smaller toys were blocking the tub.).  The house really smells great (help also by Sadie getting a bath yesterday)

I then worked out on our new  [Elliptical trainer](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000BGI5AK/bestauthors20-20/103-3126853-0951834)  (MERRY CHRISTMAS TO US FROM JACK AND LORI- Jack even installed our 3rd tv from the extra bedroom to the garage, with a TIVO so now I use the elliptical trainer when ever I want to watch GH).  

After working up a good sweat I went out and cooled off while hosing all the leaves off the patio... yes I know its supposed to rain again tomorrow - well let it.  I just wanted to get all the crap that blew on the porch during the last 2 storms.    Off to the shower and I started some laundry.

Now i&apos;m taking a break, looking a few things up I&apos;ve meant to do for a while, and then I&apos;m going to make a goat cheese pesto cheese ball for our Xmas Eve get together later, and then I&apos;m going to take Oso to get a bath.
