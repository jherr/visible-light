Our hotel while lovely had really terrible wifi - the front desk informed me that worked great with most computers - just not &quot;Apple&quot;

We spent 2 nights in Solvang,  We saw Ostriches at Ostrichland (Lame cheesy and yet fun),  We explored Danish Culture at a museum in a house that was made with no nails.  and then we went and wondered through the local mission ( [Old Mission Santa In√©s](http://www.missionsantaines.org) 
) - Megan studied California history this past year and was a wonderful tour guide.

We saw a play at the local outdoor theater. (Legally Blond - really great production.)  I introduced Megan to open face sandwiches, and we enjoyed some german delights too.

Today we headed south slightly and went   [Horseback riding on a generous hour and a half trail ride.](http://www.circlebarb.com/)   It was wonderful - my first time on a saddle in 25 years! 

Then we drove north - and tonight we are in Cambria - a really lovely town south of Hearst Castle.  We actually are on Moonstone Beach which is slightly out of town but tomorrow we&apos;ll be exploring town - checking out the elephant seals and then driving home.<br />
