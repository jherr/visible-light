Oh TIVO how I miss you... When nothings on you always have something waiting, when I need to pee you don&apos;t mind waiting for me, when I&apos;m too busy to watch my show you get it for me and keep it safe till I can watch it.

Really I&apos;m missing channel choice as well as TIVO, but I did miss the Amazing Race tonight -so don&apos;t you dare tell me what happened  - I&apos;ll watch it in 2 weeks and catch up.
