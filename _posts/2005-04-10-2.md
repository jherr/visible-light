Megan and I celebrated Justin&apos;s birthday with Justin and his family and friends at the zoo yesterday. We had a really wonderful time running around and seeing the Lions, Rhinos and Fish... There was the funny looking Okapi, and the collection of very large and very scary cockroaches.  It was all a hoot, but as we were leaving the zoo, Megan fell and cut the back of her head.  We spent about 10 mins in the guest relations while a paramedic checked her out, but it was soon obvious that while head wounds bleed alot this was really just a scrape.  Megan was a trooper through out, letting them clean it.

We headed out then  to  [Rain Forest Cafe](http://www.rainforestcafe.com/) .  Megan was delighted with all the animals there and we made several trips around the restaurant to watch them all  .  Back to the hotel for a bath and to finally get all the blood off the back of her head and thanks to some peroxide out of her clothes.  and then we both slept ... me 9 hour and Megan - who&apos;s still asleep is working on 12+ hours.
