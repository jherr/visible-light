Megan and I are heading home on wed.  I started packing up and getting ready,  took the air out of the pool toys, did some laundry etc - that kind of thing, and tuesday we are going to have grandpa drive us over to tampa and spend the night in a hotel.  Well so we thought.  Tonight I went to see a movie with Dad&apos;s neighbor and while talking she told me the 13th was friday.  Can&apos;t be I said we fly out on the 12th and that&apos;s wed.  Well ... I was wrong and we have an extra day.  So what to do with an extra day in florida.
