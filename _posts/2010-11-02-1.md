My license expires next month on my birthday.  For some reason I have to renew in person this time.  On the same day I got my renewal notice I got a jury summons so I waited to deal with the renewal until now.  I just got - &quot;No jurors are needed for the 8:00 AM roll call.&quot; so I went to the DMV website to get an appointment and have to wait until December 15th - 43 days! guess I was worried they would conflict for nothing.

Actually with a road trip soon after  I will probably just bite the bullet and go wait in line next week.  Don&apos;t think its a good idea to drive to Oregon on a temp license.
