a really cool close up shot of  [ Saturn ](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html)   It&apos;ll be something else tomorrow, but you can go back and look at the different shots.

Last night when  I was peaking out at the moon, I realized how much I miss my telescope.  I haven&apos;t taken it out since just after Megan was born.  But last night with a late rising moon and a crystal clear night, would have been perfect for a little star gazing.  Soon ... I promise my self ... soon.
