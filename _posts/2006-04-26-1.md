Catapiller who never even got a name has died.  I figured he probably would have been dead sooner had we left him on the floor of the store, but its sad that we couldn&apos;t give him a chance to transform.  Megan took the news well, and we took him outside and &quot;buried&quot; him under a bush.

She then looked at me and said ....

&quot;Can I play my video game now?&quot;
