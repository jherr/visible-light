We&apos;re getting new windows.  The four in the back and the two sliding doors are all original to the house and in pretty bad shape.  So last night we met with a representative from a local window company (our neighbor recommended) and we are going to get started - (hopefully in 6-7 weeks we&apos;ll have new windows :)
