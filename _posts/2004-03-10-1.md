we missed spring, though forecasters swear its still winter here.  Megan and I enjoyed a day at the farm after our Little gym workout.  We walked around and saw all the animals, the cows were even nice enough to stick there heads through and eat the clover from where we were standing, so Megan saw a big ol&apos; cow head up close, and said &quot;di di&quot; which is what she calls Sadie :)  

Tonight we went out for Sushi to beat the heat, and the waitresses loved that Megan ate whole meal of soybeans (edemame), Agedashi tofu, and Inari Sushi.  They said most parents pick up some BK from across the parking lot for kids.

Megan&apos;s out of the bath and free so I need to go but at least I finally got to blog.
