 [This ad from Burger King is not only real but just so wrong. ..](http://adsoftheworld.com/media/print/burger_king_veg_city_airport?size=_original) 

 just take a look at the poor onions face, the fact that the guy with the glove looks to really be enjoying his job or the pleasure of other pickle.  Not to mention the title and covers of the magazines they dumped out of his bag.  I&apos;m so glad I didn&apos;t come across this one in a an actual BK  with Megan and had to explain any of it to her...

but wait there&apos;s more ...
