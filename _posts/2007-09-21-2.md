Maybe its that I watch  [Disturbia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486822/)  earlier, and it really  got me.  

So tonight I&apos;m watching Silence of the Lambs - which I&apos;ve seen probably 4 times in the past.  I turned it on at the scene when Hannibal is talking to the Senator and got sucked in to where he escapes - such a clever man.  Anyway - I&apos;m just playing on my laptop and watching it, and the scene comes up where Buffalo Bill dances in front of the mirror, hiding his penis in the process to see his body as a woman&apos;s.  This scene has always stuck with me - girl in hole in floor thinning out so he can skin her all the while he&apos;s prancing around naked and repeating &quot;would you F_ me, I&apos;d F_ me&quot; and then it  hits me!

The actor that plays the serial killer  Clarice is after is  [Ted Levine ](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0505971/bio) - of MONK fame - you know the bumbling yet lovable Police captain.  This probably freaked me out more than the actual movie - for years I&apos;ve thought that Buffalo Bill was such a creepy character and yet I&apos;ve watched MONK and never felt the least creeped out by him - I would never in a million years guessed they were the same man.
