Dexter, Robin&apos;s black and Tan loves Megan.  This morning he gave Megan his ball and she threw it a couple of feet, he got it and gave it back to her and she did it again, by the time Robin and I got dad and the camera the moment was over, but he sure does love and look for Megan.

It&apos;s pouring here today.  Robin, Megan and I managed an early morning swim before the rain started.  We were going to go geocaching later but now we&apos;ll have to wait and see.  The weather in florida is usually rainy all summer.
