I&apos;m still walking - 5K most days which shorter 1.5 mile walks when necessary because of time.  Dogs keep me honest, though they are content with a walk around the block or a mile - as long as a treat is at the end and they can take a bit of time to sniff everything.  

The good news - my health is much improved.  I just had a physical and all my numbers are good - Weight is down a little, but my biggest change is my Cholesterol down 40 points.  All my cancer tests came back negative too. 

THe best is that I feel good.  Insomnia is gone (unless one of the dogs tries to sleep on my legs), no more shortness of breath, and less aches and pains.  

I&apos;ve also joined a local massage place and have been treating my self to 2 a month - what a difference that makes.
