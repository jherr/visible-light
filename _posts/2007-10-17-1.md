Its been a while since I did an ode to the Dyson, which I still Love and use .

Now its time to recommend  [Carbona Dye Grabber](http://store.carbona.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&ProdID=50) .  I&apos;m sure piece of terry cloth would probably do the trick as well, but this thing really pulls the loose dye out of the wash and helps keep our clothes from looking dingy.  I found them cheaper on Amazon, but linked to the company&apos;s website so that if your interested you can see all the other neat products they make.
