tonight while I was reading Megan books, she and I started counting the animals in the books.  She counted the 3 pigs all by herself, we counted the 6 sheep together and when we got to the 1 cow I asked her how many cows and she said &quot;two&quot;....&quot;two?&quot;I asked... &quot;yes two&quot;

I told her that I see one.... but where is the other and she said &quot;over there&quot; pointing to just right of the page, &quot;sleeping!&quot;
