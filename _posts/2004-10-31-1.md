A blanket of thick fog has descended on us. After getting Megan up and dress and out with dada I&apos;ve taken my cup of coffee back to bed.  The fog makes everything seem so calm and yet so isolated.  I just want to stay cuddled under my blanket for a while yet. - 

it really fits the mood of these days, It feels as though everyone is holding there breath, with anticipation or apprehension over tuesday. I think it would fine if the fog stays till then, but  it will burn off by noon knowing the bay area.
