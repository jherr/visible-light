Megan and I just arrived home from our yearly mom&apos;s and kids camping trip.  It was as always a hoot and lots of fun.  I brought a tie dye project for every one which came out great!

Yesterday we did a short hike to Pescadero Creek and the kids had fun playing the water.  We had all the great classic camping moments - Marshmallows in the fire, banana slugs all around, raccoons attempting to steal food.

On the way home we stopped once again in Half Moon Bay - had lunch and Megan and I broke off from the group and did a little shopping.

Glad to be home - with nothing in the hopper for a short while.
