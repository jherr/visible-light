I spent 32 minutes working out on Wii Fit.  I started out by knocking Winsha off the number one spot on the ski jumping! I then  did the Expert level of Boxing, The Advance Step and ran for the middle basic run.  I finished up with some stretching.  By the time I took a shower I was dripping with sweat - which is new to me since before the only exercise I really spent time on was swimming and you can never tell if your sweating then.  so now I&apos;m 7 for 7 days though one day I really took it easy and just did the games, but 6 out of the last 7 I&apos;ve worked out for 30 mins minimum.  That&apos;s a whole lot more than I would have done with out this handy dandy Wii thing.
