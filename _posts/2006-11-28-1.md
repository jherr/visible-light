Our santa has retired - remember him from last year:

The new Santa was not as nice, very down to business and matter of fact.  Megan wanted nothing to do with him but he bribed her on his lap with a happy face sticker - which freaked me out a bit - here&apos;s a kid saying no I don&apos;t want to go any where near that man in red and then he says how about for a sticker and she says ok and jumps on his lap.  Freaky and shows how easily child predators can get kids to do what they want.

Anyway - the new pic is OK - not the best as Megan was not thrilled to be there so her smile is forced - we&apos;ll probably make it part of card anyway so I&apos;m not going to post it.
