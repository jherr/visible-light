We met Josephine and her moms at Children&apos;s Fairyland in Oakland. We had a wonderful time at the Jack O Lantern Jubilee.  We rode on rides and got lots of goodies.  Megan was a puppy dog and Josephine was Sully from Monsters Inc.  It was a beautiful sunny yet cool day.  Outside the park we saw a mounted Police officer who let Megan pet her horse. 

The amazing part was with so many kids no costumes were obvious repeats, though I think I saw a few princesses.  Megan tried M&M&apos;s for the first time ever and thought they were pretty good.
