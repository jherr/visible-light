While shopping today, Megan looked down and found a caterpillar.  We took it outside and put it in a bush and went back in the store.  The rest of the time we were in the store I got 20 questions about the caterpillar like where was it, and would it turn into a butterfly, etc.  So when we left we went over and found it again.  Megan asked if we could take it home, and for a moment I thought - heck no but then I figured why not - It&apos;ll probably turn into a Moth but either way  it&apos;ll be a great learning experience.  I still had the handy plastic container the fish came in with an air hole in the top that had a raised edge and its clear so Megan can watch it.  We ran around the yard when we got home picking lots of plant leaves and we&apos;ll see what it likes to eat.  ...I&apos;ll keep you posted, and will I&apos;m sure take lots of pictures.
