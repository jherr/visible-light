When ever we go out for Sushi, Megan eats rice, miso and edamame.  She has since she was little and loves to go to Sushi. This past week we met Daddy for lunch at our favorite Sushi Harbor, and they were late with the edamame, so she had 2 bowls of Miso and some rice.  On the way out we had the edamame in hand.  On the way to the car Megan dropped the box and they spilled out, so Jack and i picked them up and threw them out while she was protesting that she wanted them.  Next day lunch I boiled her some more and presented them with sandwich.  She wouldn&apos;t touch them.  I reminded her that she was upset when she lost the ones from the restaurant and she just looked at me and shook her head.  

Today I put them out again with our sandwiches and when I grabbed one to eat  when she wouldn&apos;t, I also popped a soy bean on her plate.  She gobbled it up and asked for more.  I shelled a few dozen more before I realized i was being trained.  But hey at least she was eating a green vegetable.
