I just had a lovely outing with a friend.  We headed over to Palo Alto and had dinner at a Tapas & Wine Bar.  It was really lovely, live music, great food, fantastic wine list.  i&apos;ll be taking Jack over there soon.

Then we literally crossed the street and saw a great movie - &quot;Notes on a Scandal&quot;  Judi Dench was thoroughly slimy - an incredible performance.  The rest of the cast was excellent too but Dame Judi was so good I came home and took a shower to get the smarmy feeling off.
