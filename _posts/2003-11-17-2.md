I&apos;m totally gymboree&apos;d out.  For those of you who don&apos;t know gymboree its a play gym where kids go and climb on padded things and practice skills.  Megan loves it - which is why this afternoon we are going to go and sign up for 6 more months .  At least we get a free rocking chair for Megan.

While I&apos;m tired of the place and the activity I will say that I like having a little structure to our schedule.  Megan has been napping through playgroup so its nice to have a place we still go once a week to be with other kids.
