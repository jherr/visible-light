Megan had eaten her lunch at the grocery store (Edemame) and then again when we got home (carrots, String cheese and a fortune cookie), while I put the groceries away.  So I set her up drawing while I made myself a sandwich.  When I got to the table, Megan had colored her picture, her lip, her hair, her legs her feet and her cheek.  She wanted to go and wash off the marker from her hands, so I took a bite put my sandwich down and helped her to the sink.  As we cleaned I realized she had produced an odor so I picked her up, carried her back, changed her diaper, wiped the marker off exposed body parts and got her in clothes she can&apos;t remove for her impending nap.  When I&apos;d gotten back to the table.. my sandwich was gone - completely gone - dogs no where to be found!  (ok they were in the bay window acting guilty and licking their lips.)
