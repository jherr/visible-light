Thank goodness its not a spare the air day.  All I&apos;ve wanted for the past week is a fire and we couldn&apos;t do it for fear of a neighbor turning us in.  We have the house decked - not as I completely wanted.  I had envisioned Garland on the stairs but I haven&apos;t found enough of any Garland I like - the stairs are rather large. 

Jack did a fantastic job on the lights.  My dear little wooden rain deer that my dad made didn&apos;t survive the move though - It had been repaired a few times but the body split too much and then the antlers.  I saved all the pieces for a while to try and fix it, but finally realized it wouldn&apos;t look good even if I did manage to get it to stay together.  I&apos;m wanting Jack to build me another, but since he is busy putting in a new line of sprinklers in the back where I keep mowing the tops of them (they sat about 2 inches above the ground and hid nicely in grace).  

Christmas cards are being ordered - man I used to have them done by Thanksgiving, before life got so busy.  I&apos;m going to go bake - in the mood for pumpkin bread - with chocolate chips and pecans.

I keep singing its beginning to look a lot like Christmas...
