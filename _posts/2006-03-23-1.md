I surprised Megan this afternoon when I picked her up from school today.  I had packed us a picnic and we headed over to the local historical farm.  After eating lunch in the company of a peacock, who was very interested in us, we wondered around and looked at all the animals. Megan befriend a horse who was breaking his neck to get to the tall grass on the other side of the fence.  She happily pulled it out and fed him,  same with the sheep, though most stayed clear of us - only one actually wanted the grass she presented.  While we were walking back out a couple of hummingbirds flew by us.  It stopped me in my tracks and Megan ask me to point out the birds to her, and when I tried she just couldn&apos;t see them, so small.  So after we left we headed over to a local bird store (for bird watchers not owners) and we bought a humming bird feeder.  Once home we set it up, and I also filled all the other feeders.    

Course Megan expected birds to show up immediately, but that has not been the case, but sometime in the near future i&apos;ll be able to stay Megan look - hummingbirds.
