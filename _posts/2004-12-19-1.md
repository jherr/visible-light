I haven&apos;t blogged about the movie&apos;s i&apos;ve seen and liked (or hated) in a while so I thought I&apos;d bring you up on the last five.

1.  [National Treasure](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368891/)   This was a fun film.  Not to be taken seriously but enjoyed as you would any other adventure film.  

2.  [Ocean&apos;s 12](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0349903/)   No where near as good as the original.  Lots of funny bits but overall a choppy boring mess.  The best bit for me was Tess played by Julia Roberts trying to get away impersonating Julia Roberts.

3.  [ Bridget Jones the Edge of Reason](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317198/)   It got such bad reviews that I expected a really bad film, but went anyway since I loved the books and the first movie.  I was pleasantly surprised and throughly entertained.  If truly a Bridget fan you will enjoy this film. The cringe factor we know and love with Bridget was definitely there.  Was bummed they didn&apos;t have her interview &quot;Colin Firth&quot; as she did in the second book, though when you cast him in the lead opposite her its hard to then have her go and interview him - they could have had fun with that one.  

4.  [Finding Neverland](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308644/)  Best film I&apos;ve seen in a while by far.  Should be up for several Oscars.  Go See It!

5.  [ Spanglish](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371246/)  Kind of a long winded character study.  I enjoyed it overall but would have liked to seen about 20 mins taken out.   Fun but maybe more DVD bate.
