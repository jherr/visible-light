pre-surgery Megan and I were running around fools.  We managed to stop at 4 or 5 activities in one day of outings, which may include a couple of stores, the park or pool.  Yesterday - my first codeine free but pain-filled day I did managed Ikea since I needed to get Megan and new duvet for the full size been she&apos;s going to be getting soon.  Mission accomplished which included lunch at a close to ikea restaurant.  however when we got back I crashed and Megan watched a movie.  Today it took us even longer to get out of the house and then we only went to the grocery store.  Megan was a big help, shopping, but I feel so yucky that we are now watching yet another (actually the same) movie before nap time.

I can&apos;t wait to feel good again, to have the energy to pain and play at the park and goto the pool.
