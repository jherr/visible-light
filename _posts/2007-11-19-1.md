I managed to hurt my ankle.  Yes the same one - not entirely sure what I did but my PT guy says I&apos;ve just been over doing it.  I think it might have been the 100 or so steps to the top of the theater at film club yesterday - I wanted to sit with friends and they were in the back.  So PT today was easy - after last thursday where I really pushed it.  I really thought I was close to getting over this darn thing.  So its ice, ice, ice and take it easy.

The film for film club was excellent -but very hard to watch.  It was called  [The Savages](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/savages/)  and stars Laura Linney and Philip Seymor Hoffman as siblings who must come together and take care of their dying father.  

Megan is sick ... AGAIN! - stuffy nose and fever.  She spent her first day of the break in my bed watching movies and snoozing.
