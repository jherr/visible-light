Great day - Megan started her swimming lessons for the summer, so after a few errands we ended up at the pool.  While she was swimming a friend called and we agreed to meet back at the pool after lunch.  So after a quick bite, we ended up hanging at the pool all afternoon.  It was the perfect weather for it too.
