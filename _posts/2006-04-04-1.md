Jack discovered a few months ago that Oso loves to swim.  He has since taken Oso on a few adventures to allow him the chance to participate in this new activity.

On Sunday, after deciding he needed a bath anyway, we took Oso over to Foster City where there is a little beach on the bay.  We&apos;d gone once before with Sadie and she loved swimming too, but with Oso its almost art.

Anyway 3 movies of Oso for your viewing enjoyment - the only negative was that it was low tide, so it was more mud than water.  Next time we&apos;ll shoot for high tide.
