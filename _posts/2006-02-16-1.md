Winter is back.  We&apos;re supposed to have snow fall at 1500 feet which is the hills around us.  Megan bundled up in the car on the way to school, kept telling me how cold she was.  

I just heard a weather report that said keep your eyes out for snow fall at sea level, though it should melt immediately.  Is that possible :)

We&apos;ll probably drive up to Mt Diablo or Mr Tam this sunday and Let Megan see and experience the snow.
