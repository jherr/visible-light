A quilt store near me is going out of business - well actually she is planning on selling her business but the result is the same - she&apos;s selling things off - this week it was all fabric at 40% off.  I have only ever done projects with either precut fabric or kits so I decided it was time to bite the bullet and get enough fabric for one project.  I picked out a quilt from a book I like, and started calculating out the amounts I&apos;d need.  

The book is in metric.  Though they do have some inches listed, the one I&apos;m doing is mostly in cm.  So I took the 40 cm figure and came out with 16 inches.  Then I took 40 inches and came out with yard and 4 inches - I decided to get extra to handle mistakes and rounded up to a yard and a half.  

Do you see what I did - I jumped from 16 inches to 40 - what I needed was a foot an 1/2 and what I bought was  a yard 1/2 and this one several (keeping the exact number a secret for sanity purposes) pieces.  

Thankfully I made no such mistake with the larger pieces.  Hopefully this is the only big mistake I&apos;ll make on this quilt.<br />
