I donated blood today for the first time in over a year.  I tried back in December but was anemic.  Since starting meat that hasn&apos;t been an issue.  It felt good to be able to do it.   But my arm does throb and i&apos;m feeling exhausted.  

Megan spent the afternoon in Gymnastics camp. This week was hero week and she got to meet a police officer and his k-9 partner.  She was very excited about it, by the time she got home.  Jack asked at dinner if we had had time to swim today and Megan replied - no I&apos;m to tired to swim.  Very cute - but it means early to bed for us both.
