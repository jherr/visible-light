So far I&apos;ve raised 193.00 not the 250 I was hoping for.... if you haven&apos;t yet - there&apos;s still time

go to  [Woman&apos;s Cancer Resource Center&apos;s Swim pledge site](https://www.wsdsecure2.com/secure/wcrc/swimamile/2k6/pledge/index.cfm?mode=Pledge)  with your credit cards ready and pledge some dough - you&apos;ll be doing the easy part - I&apos;m the one who has to swim a mile :)
