No mishaps or sagas to report.  Our trip was uneventful.  No line in security, no alarms to set off.  Megan loved running round our gate and waving to all the people walking by.  She had no trouble getting in her car seat and sitting there for 4 hours.  Her feet rested on the seat in front of her, because the car seat put her there, and she did push the poor woman all the way here.  Our one trip to the restroom, meant she got a chance to look at all the people on the plane, play with the flight attendants, and then wave and smile at all the people again, so much so that we past our seat and kept going all the way to the front of coach, turned around and did it all again.  She enjoyed the exercises so much that she went to her own seat with no trauma, and settled in for some goldfish and Elmo.
