I&apos;ve been letting Megan in the bathroom while I go &quot;potty&quot; in hopes of encouraging her on that endeavor.  Yesterday after I pooped - I let her flush and she said &quot;Yucky Mommy poopy Potty.&quot;  Time passed, we went to Costco, shopped and for me the whole incident was forgotten.  Megan started chatting with the old man in line behind us and she proudly informed him - &quot;Mommy Poopy Potty&quot; ... &quot;YUCKY!&quot;  I kid you not - I blushed and the old man chuckled and said that was good for mommy.

On a side note - today at playgroup one of the slightly older boys who is currently going through potty training, needed to go potty and the mom let Megan watch.  As soon as everyone left she told me &quot;meme Potty&quot; and proceeded to pee in the toilet for the first time ever! - Yeah Megan!
