I&apos;ve been sick all weekend.  I have one of the worst colds i&apos;ve ever had.  I&apos;ve barely managed to be up and about.  I did manage some laundry today and to run the vacuum, but I missed Pam and Yvonne&apos;s third wedding (Please people vote No on 8!), and Derek&apos;s Birthday party today.  

That is what I get for hanging around with kids  during the week.
