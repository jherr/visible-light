Overall it was a good flick - very entertaining.  My biggest complaint was that it was too choppy - I felt like lots of the movie was cut out and the editor hacked at it with no rhyme or reason.  The acting was good, the effects were cool (I particularly liked the scenes in St Peters cathedral since I know the catholic church wouldn&apos;t have allowed them.  I&apos;d give it a 6 or 7 out of 10 and I&apos;m up for the sequal, which probably won&apos;t be made since the theater was empty.

I tend to like thrillers, and thriller that throw in religious history and mystisim get my attention.
