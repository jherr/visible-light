As most of you probably know, Jack and I have been trying to have another baby.  We&apos;ve had no luck so far, and when my period started yesterday I felt so depressed, and incredibly sorry for myself.  Last night when Jack came home from work I was in a foul mood and unfortunately I took it out on him.  The ups and downs of trying to get pregnant are draining and brutal.  

Of course, perspective came not once but twice today.  First when Jack told me about  [Dear Elena](http://dearelena.wordpress.com/)  the blog of a man Jack met through his work, that just lost his 6 year old daughter.  Its amazingly brave for him to share what he is going though with the blog world.  

Then this morning I found out that a friend, who was pregnant with twins has lost them both.  As I drove myself to the doctor today to discuss options, and get prescriptions for all the hormones so we could begin the process again, I couldn&apos;t help but think about how very lucky I am, that I have Megan and Jack, and that it&apos;s all so precious.  I need to hold on tight to what I have and accept that I may never have more, but that&apos;s ok, because what I already have is wonderful.
