We canceled our vacation rental for June last night.  We were planning on going to Mexico staying right on the Ocean in a beautiful 4 bedroom home out side of Puerto Vallarta.  We had some concert about a month ago when we we heard that kidnappings of American&apos;s were up in Mexico, but we decided we would be ok in PV because the kidnappings were taking place near the border.  But this Swine FLu was kind of the oman that we decided we couldn&apos;t ignore.  Its just not worth the risk for a vacation.  Maybe in a few years we can try again.  

For now we are looking into Arizona - Swine Not.
