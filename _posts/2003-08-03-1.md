We all managed to go out to breakfast this morning by 8:30 and then Mike and Missy and Justin headed straight to the high way from the resterant.  The rest of the gang back to the house so they could finish packing up.  

Then David, Jordan and Kelly went off in one car and Robin and Sam went off in the other, Megan went down for a nap and dad and I kicked back and relaxed in the quiet.  (we are both surfing on our ibooks)

I&apos;m planning on heading out to the Market of Marion when Megan wakes up, though it may be too hot for an outdoor market, and i haven&apos;t done my Bealls shoe shopping yet this trip :)
