The democrats are so sure they are going to win this november thanks in large part to the illegal wire tapping, and the war that will not end.  Now they have Bush&apos;s budget to jump on since basically he is stealing from the poor to feed his war machine.

But I wonder if remember how easily elections get stolen in this country.  And how people seem to forget all the bad and vote on one issue. I&apos;m not believing anything until after the votes are counted and rechecked.
