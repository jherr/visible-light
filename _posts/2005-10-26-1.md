I&apos;ve been packing this evening, getting ready to fly to Florida tomorrow. I guess i&apos;d pushed out my mind how hard it would be to leave Megan even for 3 days.  I&apos;ve been close to tears all day - like I have a catch in my breath.  Tonight as I tucked her in I just wanted to stay cuddled forever. I know its only 3 days, and Jack and Megan will have a great time.  I can&apos;t believe I ever thought this was a good idea.
