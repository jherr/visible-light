Here&apos;s a link for a trailer to the movie  [ Alien Trespass](http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/alientrespass/)  which I saw at film club a week or so ago.  It was an entertaining homage to the 1950&apos;s movies like &quot;It came from Outer Space.&quot; 

If that is your thing then I recommend it.
