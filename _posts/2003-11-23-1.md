I saw Love Actually and Master and Commander this weekend.  I recommend the first to everyone who needs a laugh and the later to anyone who needs a testosterone fix.  Of the two I enjoyed Love Actually by far more.  But it was more directed to me.  I was the only female alone in Master and Commander but one of many females alone in Love Actually. 

And Love Actually had Colin Firth - You can&apos;t go wrong with Mr Firth.
