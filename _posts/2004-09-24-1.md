I just couldn&apos;t believe this one...  The Republican party lies and admits they lie to mobilize there own party - they think that little of their own people that they feel they have to lie to them to mobilize them!

From The New York Times:
The Republican Party acknowledged yesterday sending mass mailings to residents of two states warning that &quot;liberals&quot; seek to ban the Bible. It said the mailings were part of its effort to mobilize religious voters for President Bush.

The mailings include images of the Bible labeled &quot;banned&quot; and of a gay marriage proposal labeled &quot;allowed.&quot; A mailing to Arkansas residents warns: &quot;This will be Arkansas if you don&apos;t vote.&quot; A similar mailing was sent to West Virginians.

A liberal religious group, the Interfaith Alliance, circulated a copy of the Arkansas mailing to reporters yesterday to publicize it. &quot;What they are doing is despicable,&apos;&apos; said Don Parker, a spokesman for the alliance. &quot;They are playing on people&apos;s fears and emotions.&quot;

In an e-mail message, Christine Iverson, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, confirmed that the party had sent the mailings.
