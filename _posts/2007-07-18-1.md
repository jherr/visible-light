I actually slept pretty well.  Megan and I went camping last night with some mom friends.  So I slept as well as I can in a tent in the rain. We all chipped in and made a feast for dinner, while the 4 year olds explored and rain around and hunted banana slugs.  Then this morning we all made a quick breakfast in the rain and broke camp.  We&apos;d planned a bigger morning but doing anything is less appealing in a constant drizzle.

Still we had a great time and hope to do it again soon.  I think maybe for 2 nights though - cause this one night camping is a hell of a lot of work!.
