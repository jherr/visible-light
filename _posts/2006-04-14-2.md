Megan and I joined playgroup today for an open play time at a local gymnastics place.  We had a blast and will definitely do it again.  One of the highlights was this big pit of foam cubes each about a foot long.  The pit is probably 6 or 7 feet deep with no stairs or steps like a pool.  I sat with my feet dangling in when my sock got eaten by some of the foam.  So not thinking I went in after it.  And well ... I got stuck.  It took me what seemed like an hour but was probably just a couple of minutes to build a step high enough to give me a good leg up.  Each time I tried I would smooch the the cubes and sink further in..I never felt the bottom. I did get out, but not before another mom got a picture... I&apos;ll post it if she emails it to me :)
