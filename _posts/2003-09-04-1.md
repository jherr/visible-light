Megan and I had a lovely day in Santa Cruz.  We drove down during her first nap on Hwy 17, which was suprisingly clear.  We arrived and started out shopping, had lunch at Saturn Cafe (a vegetarian dinner) then walked down the main drag stopping and shopping along the way.  We ended up back at the car by 2:30 where Megan nursed before another nap on the way home.  It really worked out great.
