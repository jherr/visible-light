Today is Jack and my 12th anniversary. Its been a good 12 years.  I&apos;m married to the most compassionate, intelligent and loving person I&apos;ve ever known.  I count myself fortunate that Jack not only found me 12 years ago, but still wants to be with me today.    I love you Jack, thank you for 12 wonderful years, I&apos;m looking forward to many many more.

To celebrate, Megan is going to spend the day with our friends Pam, Yvonne and Josephine and we are going to have brunch at Lark Creek Cafe in Walnut Creek. We decided our A/C for the house is our gift to ourselves, and though it hasn&apos;t been really hot since we had it installed, its been nice just knowing its there.
