We&apos;re heading home today after an all to short visit with &quot;Grandma and Pops&quot;.  We ended the trip with a very successful  [geocache on an island in the middle of the lake](http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=64566b67-3500-4efb-97da-8a4e1c8778dc) .  The boat ride out was chilly, but the hike was fairly easy and Megan found the treasure!.  Unfortunately the last finders had left the lid off so everything was a bit wet and dirty but we got it all back together.

Now i&apos;m doing a final load of laundry and packing up while Megan watches  [Kiki&apos;s Delivery service](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097814/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9a2lraSBkZWxpdmVyeSBzZXJ2aWNlfGZ0PTF8bXg9MjB8bG09NTAwfGNvPTF8aHRtbD0xfG5tPTE_;fc=1;ft=6;fm=1)  with grandma and Pops!

We have a late evening flight out of Greenville, and should get into SFO after midnight.
