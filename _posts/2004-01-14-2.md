Megan and I had a great day planned for today.  First we were supposed to go to the library for toddler time, a new program we registered for, and then we were supposed to meet a friend at the Palo Alto Junior Museum. 

First we tried the library.  We got into the side room and the librarian in-charge of the program told me Megan had to sit in my lap for the whole 30 mins, no running around and she wasn&apos;t allowed to be noisy.  Megan of course wanted to run free and was vocal in opposition to me trying to hold her close.  So we left and on the way out I told the reference librarian we won&apos;t be back. 

Then we headed across the bay to meet our friend and the rain started.  The museum is also a zoo (outside) so I called our friend and we met them at their house instead and had playtime and lunch.  We stopped by Jack&apos;s work on the way home so Megan could see dad.  Jack had to work late so this gave them a few minutes of of playtime.  Then we headed home for a nap.

It wasn&apos;t a bad day - just not the day we planned.
