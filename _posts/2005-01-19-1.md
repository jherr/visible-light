I am so thankful Jack is home from work early and is playing with Megan so i can go back to bed and let my body be sick.

My simple cold from a week or so ago has migrated to my chest and now thanks to a trip to the dr on monday am on an inhaler, cough syrup of the go to sleep and never get up variety, and an antibiotic.  

I&apos;ve never had breathing difficulties this bad and now I have new found awe for people who deal with this on a regular basis - like Jack who has asthma.  Not being able to breath is perhaps the scariest thing I&apos;ve ever experienced.
