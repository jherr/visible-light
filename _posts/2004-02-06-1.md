Megan and I enjoyed the zoo this morning.  We joined the  [ OAKLAND ZOO](http://www.oaklandzoo.org/)  so now we can go as many times as we want for the next year.  Better still we get to get into lots of other zoo&apos;s and aquariums discounted or for free.  

Megan enjoyed the flamingos, camels, lions, zebras, monkeys.  We enjoyed lunch in the cafe which was by far the best zoo food I&apos;ve ever had.  We finished up the day with a ride on the train and the carrousel twice.
