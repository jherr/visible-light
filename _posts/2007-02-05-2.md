I don&apos;t want Jack to take any offense to what i&apos;m about to say but... 

(Don&apos;t you just love things that start that way?)  

I thought the man was insane - He would get so into exercise that that was all he talked about - he would live and breath it and I who was never into it would just go bonkers.  Add to that the fact that I never got why people would do marathons, or swim around Key West, or hike the Appellation trail (or Hike period!)  I just figured I wasn&apos;t give the gene that made me want to exercise.  

But now I&apos;m hooked.  I can&apos;t imagine my life with out it.

Last week I swam M T W F and did my work out video M, W, Th, Sat 2 times with a Hike on Tuesday and Yoga on friday night.  I look back at my log and I&apos;m amazed with myself and yet... when I took Sunday to rest my body - I ended up in the yard pulling out a bush (with Jack&apos;s able assistance) because the thought of sitting still all day made me cringe.  I actually did a bunch of cleaning up in the yard, and I washed both dogs.  

I can&apos;t say this enough - it feels good. Really really good.
