I&apos;m currently baking  [Two Corn Casserole](http://clientandserver.com/archives/000362.html)  for Megan&apos;s schools thanksgiving party.  This lovely dish was one my sister used to make for Fish Fry&apos;s when she was married to her first husband, Brian.  It was one we all loved to gobble up and its a great one to take to pot lucks. - Perfect for Thanksgiving too.
