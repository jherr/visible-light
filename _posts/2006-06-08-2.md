Jack and I went to see  [An Inconvenient Truth](http://www.climatecrisis.net)  Al Gore&apos;s brilliant piece on global warming.  Every parent, concerned citizen, consumer,  voter and human, needs to see this film.  It really does an excellent job of conveying its message. 

I dare everyone to go see it for themselves.  If its not showing near you then demand it.
