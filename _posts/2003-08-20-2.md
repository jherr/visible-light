During the day I have a recurring notion that something that is happening would make a great blog, more interesting than my usual play by play, and then I get home or get to a place where I can get my lap top open, maybe even open the blog editor and then blank - my mind goes absolutely blank.  This happened to me at least 3 times today and I can&apos;t for the life of me remember what I wanted to blog about.  I&apos;m sure it was great what ever it was... you&apos;ll just have to take my word for it ;)
