While Megan was watching a movie this afternoon I decided to vacuum the latest layer of dog hair.  Oso who is terrified of the vacuum high tailed it to my bedroom (where Megan was)  I then decided to shut the door so Megan could hear the movie over the vacuum.  Both seemed fine.  

I started it up and as I was heading back out into the garage to vacuum the rug going into the house I realized I could hear the rain - strange I thought but continued.  As I was coming back in I heard and then saw Oso banging on the sliding door.  I looked out beyond him and it was hailing - the fool was standing in a hail storm because he was terrified and needed my lap.
