This latest Harry Potter movie is the best so far, and really keeps the magic of the books going.  Its only a little choppy in parts unlike its predecessors.  It makes me eager for the next installment.  Gary Olman is an excellent pick for Sirus Black, and I loved Emma Thompson as the Divination teacher.  Alan Rickman was his usual excellent self, but his character in this book was neglected.  Looking forward to more of him in the coming movies.  

I recommend it to fans of the books -- even  you who don&apos;t like sticky floors and crowds.   The movie is good and seeing it in the big screen is worth the minor discomfort of going to a theater.
