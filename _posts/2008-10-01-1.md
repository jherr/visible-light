Megan&apos;s first tooth story got lost in the blogging nightmare - or rather the provider of our sites &quot;upgrades&quot;.  Time to look for a new provider I think, but that isn&apos;t my department.

Anywho - Megan lost her first tooth at a b-day party last week.  She actually pulled it out herself...

I&apos;ll repost the pic here as soon as I figure out how again.  Jack  - macfusion won&apos;t connect to muttmansion.

on the quilt front - I finished the quilt finally and will post a picture of that as soon as I get the above mentioned problem settled and actually take a picture.
