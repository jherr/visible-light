So its raining again... and while this is not unusual for California in March, I&apos;m not amused since I just had my car washed today!  Megan and I had about 30 minutes before her gym class and I had an empty gas tank so I went in for a fill up and answered yes to the car wash question.  It looked good till the sun went down!

Megan&apos;s replacement purple Disney Bears arrived today! so now I have one I can give her while I try and repair the Oso damaged one (and maybe wash it) and I have one good back up.  Thank you Missy for the heads up on how to get ahold of them!

Now onto my funny Megan story for the day - she stripped during her nap - not unusal - but she then proceeded to Poop!  She tried to get the diaper back on but then just laid there until I went in and told her to take her nap already (she was singing happily)  There was poop on everything (and is why I&apos;m going to try washing the bear!) 

YUCK!
