At the beginning of summer Megan started sleeping in - first 8 then 9 and sometimes even 10.  I made plans based on this new sleeping pattern and then I too started sleeping in - it was wonderful!

but early last week she started rising again at 7.  And it became daily so I adjusted my clock again.  Now I rise at 7 and today - well its 9 and she&apos;s still asleep!
