Must be the heat, Megan is really tired today.  She is down for her second long nap and I&apos;m hesitant to start any projects for fear that she will wake up but yet she seems to be sleeping forever.

Ripley is asleep in the bay window and Sadie is on the floor in the hall.  I should probably join them all but I feel like  have so much to do.
