Another day another Jr Ranger Booklet.  This one definitely the most demanding of the trip.  Mt Lassen NP is a park filled with volcanos - having all 4 types in the park boundaries.  It is located East of Redding, well off of I-5 with beautiful National Forests surrounding it.

We arrived, picked up the booklet, explored the museum, watched the movie on the park, and then headed out on the trail of Lake Manzanita and had a picnic on the water.  

We rushed back to the visitor center to attend a ranger talk and turned out to be the only people attending (thanks to the Jr Ranger book which requires it) so we were able to discuss all aspects of the park with the Ranger, and Megan wowed us with her knowledge of rocks (she was listening in school!)

A side trip to the Lassen camp store for ice cream ...

before heading on through the park a bit to the &quot;Devastated Area&quot;  a well maintained trail through a bunch of boulders that at once time were lava bombs.

(this last one is called Hot Rock - discovered after the 1915 eruption still sizzling 3 days later.

Lassen is still snowed in and so that was as far as we could go - the road closed.  THe ranger had told us the southern end is opened but only 5 miles and it would take over an hour to drive around the park and come back up the southern end.  Not sure bubbling mud is really worth it, but it might be doable on our way out of here.

We actually saw only snow on much higher elevations but I guess the road goes up much higher then we had. 

Back to the KOA for a much needed swim, camp cooked dinner, swim, campfire (worked on Jr. ranger book and ate blacken marshmallows, finally showers, an episode of Star trek and bed - and somewhere in there we called Jack to touch base as the wifi costs here and is not free and I am too cheap to pay. (and again no cell coverage.

On a side - I have been all over the back side of California and Oregon this trip with little to no cell service and have been just fine.  But when I leave my house and go to the store without my phone I immediately panic that I will get a flat or get mugged and half the time drive back home to get the phone- go figure.

More Lassen tomorrow along with a Radio Telescope observatory and another Lava Tube Cave.<br />
