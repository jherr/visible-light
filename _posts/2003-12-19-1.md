I agree with most of Jack&apos;s review.  I think the DVD with extended scenes will probably help the choppiness of the 3rd movie like it did the first 2 movies.  I got different previews than Jack and so I was a bit bummed that I didn&apos;t get to see the Chronicles of Riddick trailer - I was bummed with the Mask 2 trailer.
