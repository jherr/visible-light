Aside from this blog which I&apos;ve had since 2007, I&apos;m taking full advantage of social networking.  I really enjoy Facebook, and interacting with people I know and a few I&apos;ve never met.   Most recently, I&apos;ve gotten to know a relation a bit better,  brought together by sad news, but it turns out she and I have so much in common.  

I&apos;ve recently discovered a new source of entertainment -  [Pinterest.](https://pinterest.com/ )  Let me know if you want an invite.  I had to have a friend walk me through it, bribed with a cup of tea, but it is wonderful - sharing tidbits you find on the internet.  

I&apos;m also doing my365  which is a photo a day type of deal -  [Here is my pic from yesterday ](http://my365.in/muttmansion/p/1509566)  a day with great moments, all worth capturing. 

Let me sidetrack and just tell you what a fabulous day my friday was.  I woke up and got the girl ready for school, and then watched as her dad biked off with her.  I then headed across the bay to use a xmas gift card to Water Course Way - a wonderful spa.  If you get a 9am Massage you get a tub room for free so I got a steam room, with hot tub and for the first time since this dry cold sunny winter started I was able to get moisture in my nose.  The massage after was fabulous.  The woman really got out every ache and pain and I haven&apos;t felt this good in years.

I went home after and had a lovely lunch with Jack, then he dropped me and my bike off at the school and I helped a class of 32 forth graders make plaster cast masks.  Megan&apos;s class does it next week - this was me trying it out.  Megan and I biked home and then, after piano lesson for Megan, I cooked an early dinner of Rice, beans and sausage, before we headed out to a family dance at Megan&apos;s school, where Megan danced with her dad, and I got to spend the hour or so socializing with my friends.  Here is a pic of Jack and Megan ... ![](/images/assets/IMG_0917-thumb-600x800-204.jpeg)
