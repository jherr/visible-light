Well really not a bad week - we just had Jack&apos;s wrist to deal with.  With the worst of the broken wrist behind us, We had a really lovely saturday.  

We started the day with a trip to the farmers market.  It was chilly but the produce was fresh and the local hospital had a chef there who made a fresh salad and some bread with cilantro pesto.  Megan even dared to sample the pesto and loved it, so I&apos;m making my own version to go with our dinner tonight.

After a quick lunch at a sandwich we enjoyed &quot;Seussical the musical&quot; put on by a local Elementary in Fremont.  The kids did a great job.  One of our playgroup friends big sister did  the best performance as Gertrude - and has a future in theatre if she wants it.

It really just was a great day.  And now after our fresh breadrolls come out of the oven we&apos;ll have a great dinner. 

Tomorrow , will be one week since Jack&apos;s fall and while so much has changed, really nothing has.
