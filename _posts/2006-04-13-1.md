Oso steals toys.  When ever we leave the house he goes into Megan&apos;s room and gets himself what ever stuffed animal he likes.  Its usually one she&apos;s been playing with recently.  I wish I could be a fly on the wall and watch him decide.  Then he takes it out and sleeps with it.  Very cute and silly.

He has never to my knowledge chewed them, or done anything but move them around the house and use them as pillows.  Some times there are several in a pile in the kitchen - as if to say &quot;see, i&apos;m very good... but.... leave me again and the teddy gets it.&quot;
