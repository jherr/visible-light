David came into town today for work.  He had the whole afternoon and evening free though so I offered to pick him up at the airport so we could hang out and then I drove him to his hotel in San Francisco tonight.

Megan and I drove up to get him after her swim lesson and on the way she asked me all sorts of questions, like was he Uncle Doodlebug, and would &quot;Uncle Davin&quot; sleep at our house, and did Uncle Davin see Mel on his trip?  (See Mel she still thinks of you often though you&apos;ve been gone for what 8 months now!)

Megan was incredibly shy with him when we met up at SFO.  When we got in the car she started singing but anytime he looked back at her she got bashful.  When we got to the house she let him unbuckle her and then she ran in and was so excited to show him her room and all her toys.  By dinner she was asking to sit next to him in the car and at the restaurant.  He took a picture of her with his cell phone while she was eating broccoli to show his girls - Megan loves her veggies.  She held his hand while we crossed streets to get a coffee, played in the car with him on the way back to the house.  

But then we made a move to leave and Megan turned shy again - she didn&apos;t even want to blow kisses, though she did manage a &quot;Bye&quot;.
