What a hoot this new show is on Bravo.  The 5 gay men take over a straight guy&apos;s life and show him style.  The episode I watch took an artist in NY who lived in overalls and helped him find a comfortable style.  They also cleaned his apartment, took him to get a haircut, style, gave him tips on conversing in a party, and finally the chef of the group helped him cook mini pizza&apos;s.  The best part was the dish session at the end where they watched him goto his first gallery showing for his work and commented on how looked, behaved etc.  I&apos;m not giving it justice and it&apos;ll get old fast but it was a funny show.
