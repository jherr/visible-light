I started a compost bin.  Actually I did one before but lost interest.  Our city has a great policy of composting with our yard waste, so really I have no reason, but that I want to.

So Anyway ... I went out yesterday to mix it up and when I opened the lid I jumped way back because of the maggots! - I ran and got the hose, and then I approached - skin crawling - damn I hate maggots - since I worked at the morgue and a body came in once just crawling with them... 

Anyway I approached slowly because I was sure some big maggot monster was just going to jump out and I was ready with the hose to defend myself.  Thats when I saw - it was just Rice! - the rice I had put out there 2 nights before!
