 [Union City](http://www.ci.union-city.ca.us/index.htm)  has redesigned the city&apos;s website and its so much nicer and easier to use than before - make it look like such a wonderful place to live.

I get a chuckle out of how the city puts &quot;Gateway to Silicon Valley&quot; on all the Union City signs and the yet the Crowne Plaza Hotel has the slogan &quot;Oakland South&quot; - ok Guess you have to know the area to see the humor in this contradiction.
