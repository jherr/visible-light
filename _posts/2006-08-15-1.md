My dad just left after a really lovely visit.  It along with my lap top being in the shop is why I haven&apos;t been blogging much - except to ask for  [donations for the swim a thon](/vl/archives/003062.html) 

While Dad and Mumsie were here we went down to Monterey and visited the aquarium.  Then we did the 17 mile drive along the pebble beach.  We did a driving tour of San Francisco, including a drive across the golden gate and up-to the Marin Headlends.  We enjoyed some really great food and on Friday we got the sitter and took them to our new favorite haunt  [Nola&apos;s](http://www.nolas.com) 

The visit gave me a chance to get to know Pat, who I had never had the chance to really talk with, and to see my dad so happy.  A state I haven&apos;t seen him in, in a really really long time.  He&apos;s a giddy school boy and that is just wonderful.

After they left on Saturday, we took it really easy including some time at the pool.  We introduced Megan to my favorite movie  [The Princess Bride](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/)   and Sunday Megan and I went to the farmers market and the pool before Josephine came over to play with the sitter and while we went out with Pam and Yvonne for some pub time.

My lap top which I dropped off at the apple store last monday, was back by Thursday morning.  It had a new motherboard installed and a whole new bottom.  Thank goodness I bought that extended warranty.
