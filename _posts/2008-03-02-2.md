Health care is a major issue.  Jack and I enjoyed Socialized Medicine in Australia.  I remember going to the doctor there to get the pill and they basically gave me a 6 month supply as part of my check up - the fee was like 10 dollars all included.  I was blown away - I had never paid so little for birthcontrol!  I never had a problem getting in to see a doctor for colds,  or first aid when Jack ran over the back of my foot with a shopping cart and ripped it opened.    We  never had anything major happen while we were there, and half way through our time &quot;little Johnny Howard&quot; came to power and revoked our right to the medical system.  

SO tonight I was watching  [Watch It](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/02/28/60minutes/main3889496.shtml)  and be ashamed that this powerful country we live in has to turn to this group.  Its amazing.
