I&apos;ve noticed a bit of lying lately.  Politicians are the obvious culprits and while annoying very expected.

Megan too has been testing the waters with a couple of easy lies - like she told me she flushed the toilet, when she hadn&apos;t, or that she&apos;d washed her hands when she hadn&apos;t, but these are learning moments and even cute though not tolerated.

But today I had a repair man who came today while I was out, after a week of not returning my phone calls - tell me he&apos;d talked to someone here and arranged to come out today at 12 - I blew up at this jerk - Firstly I have caller ID and he never called here.  Secondly he claimed my husband made the appointment - which I know is also a lie, then he said GE whom I have the service contract with arranged the time - not how they work.    It really ticks me off that people think they can get away with blatantly lying to me.  I told him if this is your work ethic, I didn&apos;t want him working on my oven and that I would call GE to complain and get a new servicer. - then I hung up on him.
