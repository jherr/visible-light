So far all is well, and quiet.  Megan is having her first friend sleep over.  Josephine&apos;s parents  had separate trips for work and asked us to watch Josephine over night.  She&apos;s been an absolute angel, and the girls have had  a lot of fun playing.  They are both still awake, but I expected that.  And i&apos;m sure as tired as they are that we&apos;ll have sleeping girls soon.
