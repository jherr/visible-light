Each year I like to see all the Oscar nominated films for Best Picture before the awards show.  Usually from nominations to the awards show I have about 3 pictures to watch.  This year, however I&apos;ve seen all the best picture nominated films...so For a change I&apos;m going to shoot for seeing all the pictures that the actors are nominated for.  That means I need to see  House of Sand and Fog, In America, 21 Grams, Pieces of April, and Thirteen.  It&apos;ll be a challenge since most of these are art house films. - Pieces of April and Thirteen are both out on DVD.  In America and 21 Grams are in the theater so it looks like the tough one will be House of Sand and Fog.
