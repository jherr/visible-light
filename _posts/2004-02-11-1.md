Megan got some shots a few weeks ago.  Over the weekend, the spot where the shot went in had a small red bump.  Then yesterday t was about the size of a pea, today it was triple that size so I called Megan&apos;s dr and spoke with the nurse on staff.  She said wow - she&apos;s having a reaction, bring her in...so I rushed her in.  We were taken into a room right away.  Her doctor wasn&apos;t in today so another dr came in and he really didn&apos;t get why we were there.  He noticed she had a cold so assumed I&apos;d brought her in for that.  I finally got him to understand we were there for the bump on the leg and he looked at it and said - ah bug bite.  NO I said and explained that that was the point of her injection and light bulb.  He still wasn&apos;t concerned, took his pen and drew a line around it and said if it gets bigger bring her back. 

I&apos;m just hoping her regular doc is in if it does get bigger.
