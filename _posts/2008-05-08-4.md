Every night that I put Megan to bed we play this little game.  I love you more, well I love you 100 times more than you love me, I love you a million times more, we&apos;ve gotten all the way to googolplex and then added to infinity and beyond.   At some point Megan said well I just know I love you more, to which I replied that is just not possible.  and now our favorite phrase is &quot;not Possible!&quot;

In order to assure bed time doesn&apos;t drag on and on our routine is pretty much adhered too since she was a year or so old, and that includes a few songs from a mix tape I made for her.  In order to save my sanity (from repeats) we&apos;ve started each picking one song - she always goes for the same one but I can add a bit of variety. Then at the end we hug and kiss and she goes to bed.  But tonight I noticed that at the point when the song was coming to a close and we both knew it, we do this thing where we grab onto each other, and just hug so tight - as if to say I just won&apos;t let you go!  But when the song ends we do, with lots of promises for love in the morning - who knew being a mom could be so good!
