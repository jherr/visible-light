We got in late last night - or rather early this morning.  Our flight out of Atlanta was for 9:30 pm so we&apos;d planned on leaving SC late morning and then making our way to the  [same lovely Sushi place](http://www.kanihouse.com/)  Megan and i found on the way out to Pop&apos;s and found a Borders as well.  

We finally made it to the aquarium at about 1, we were told upon entering the parking garage that we could not actually enter until after 4 because of over crowding.  We decided to forget the aquarium and headed over to the  [most convoluted Mall ever](http://www.simon.com/mall/default.aspx?ID=207) .  Its upscale and has great shops, but the layout is so crazy.  We killed some time, getting Gee some new sandals at Buster Browns, before decided to go ahead to the airport and have dinner there.

With lots of time to kill we explored a few of the restaurants but ended up at a mini-chili&apos;s.  The Drinks were fine, and by the time we hit the gate Neither Jack nor I minded to much that our plane was delayed by 30 minutes. 

The flight was uneventful.  Megan and Jack slept, and I read the first 1/3rd of  [Under the Banner of Heaven](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400032806/sr=8-1/qid=1154355820/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-5004702-7610219?ie=UTF8) , played Lemmings and tried the really bad movie Delta offered, for the first 20 minutes.  Jack and I split up at the airport and while I got the bags out to the curb he went and got the car out of long term parking.  Our dogsitter (also babysitter) had kindly made our bed so we were able to go straight to bed, after showers and a little unpacking. 

Megan slept til 7 and we are both planning a nap today.  There is no place like home.
