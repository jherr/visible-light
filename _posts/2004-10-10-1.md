On the advice of a friend I joined the  [Camera Cinema Club ](http://www.cameracinemas.com/clubmemb.html) .  It means that once a month I&apos;ll enjoy a movie, possibly brand new not yet released.    The only twist is that you don&apos;t know what is going to be the movie until it the movie starts.

Today&apos;s movie was  [Sundance](http://www.sundancefilm.com/festival/?PHPSESSID=b58acb3b68d431a0c82b9a66f7dac6b2)  and will open here in a few weeks.  I really enjoyed it though I spent most of it feeling thoroughly confused.  Its was an interesting take on time travel.  The writer/producer/director/actor of it, Shane Carruth, was there to answer questions after.  For only $7000 the movie is a surprising entertaining piece of cinema.
