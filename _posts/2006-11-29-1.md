while swimming today I noticed this nice old man watching me.  He was in the water arobics class and I was swimming in the fast lane next to him.  Every time I past him or looked over he was watching me and he wasn&apos;t even shy about it.  So When I was kicking (with kickboard head above water) I asked him &quot;Are you watching me?&quot;

He replied &quot;yes yes I am&quot; in the best Barry White impression i&apos;ve ever heard.  

When I returned on my next lap he said ... &quot;your just so fine  to watch&quot;! ... I laughed and said you sir are good for my self esteem  - at this point all the other old men laughed with us and now I have my own personal fan club.

The icing on the cake came when I was getting out of the pool and a little slip of a woman asked me if I was one of the life guards... NO I said and she said well you sure swim really good you should be :)

FITNESS UPDATE:  I am at the fittest I&apos;ve ever been.  I was able to carry Megan around parts of disney up on my back and I walked around all 4 parks sick and was actually fine-  never achy etc.  I missed 2 weeks of swimming but when I went back in the pool last friday I had no trouble getting back into it and doing the mile. Today I did 200 butterfly without my fins, and I used a pull buoy so when I was just  pulling I was really working my arms. I&apos;m down a pants size and two sizes in swim suits.
