Megan woke up at 4 throwing up.  Thankfully she&apos;d digested dinner so it was just some bile. Jack changed the sheets and I got her all cleaned up and we all went back to bed.  She did it again at 6 only this time Jack was already up for work, and i&apos;d had the baby monitor on so I heard her start and was in in a flash - able to hold her over the trash can and save the sheets.

She tried to go back to bed, but couldn&apos;t so at 6:40 she came in and joined me for some blues clues.  She said she felt better so I gave her alittle water... and well that came up.  So now you know where we&apos;ll be - close to the potty, watching lots of tv.
