Teachers in my district got pink slips today.  They are planning on increasing class sizes to save money.  I am so angry - 

so I started an  [online Petition](http://www.petitiononline.com/nhusd1)  - so far with just an email out on my parent group and one to the teacher rep and the union we gotten 120 signatures - and that is just from 11 am this morning.  Hopefully we&apos;ll have a big printout of it on Tuesday to deliver to the school board.

New Haven Unified School District, Class Size Reduction, Board of Education, petition
