Tonight we had over some friends for dinner.  I made Pan seared steaks 4 mins on a side, (London Broil Cut) with a red wine (Thyme, shallot, broth and butter) sauce.  To go with it I made Broiled asparagus with a Balsamic Reduction, and a salad with a really lovely homemade dressing (in the salad was mixed greens, grape tomatoes, hearts of palm, caramelized onions, walnuts, avocado, carrots, and celery.  

Jack made lava cake for dessert - truly wonderful chocolately goodness.  The kids all ate a pizza we threw together.
