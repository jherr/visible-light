Its finally raining again -after 2 weeks of summer like days and cool nights.  We need the rain but I understand its a short storm.  

I took Megan to the zoo on monday with a friend of hers.  I had a great time -but man two  6 year olds are exhausting!

I&apos;m getting ready to teach another art lesson to Megan&apos;s class. Oh and Little guy ate Megan&apos;s library book!  that&apos;ll cost us 25 bucks.
