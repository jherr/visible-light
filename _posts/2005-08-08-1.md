I decided yesterday to switch from codeine to Tylenol so that i could be more than just zombie mom for Megan this week.  Also my stomach was starting to have series issues with the codeine and the advice on the side of the bottle to take with food was nearly impossible to follow.  So I tried it for the first time while Megan was out of the house and survived, and so i&apos;ve been &apos;off&quot; the codeine now for 24 hours.  While I am considerably more alert - I&apos;m in serious pain.  Tylenol has nothing on codeine for pain relief.
