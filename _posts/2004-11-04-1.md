Subject: Because of you, there is hope.

&quot;we must remember that 55.4 million Americans stood with you and with John Kerry. You are certainly not alone. And a healthy environment, a strong and fair economy, good schools, domestic safety and the end of the war in Iraq are goals we all share &quot;

Remember that Mister Bush ... 55.4 Million Americans don&apos;t want you as president while we will have to tolerate you for the next 4 years, we&apos;ll be watching you like a hawk, and we&apos;ll be ready, so get honest with the American people and do your job. 

I heard on the radio today that even though he won,55.4 million voters plus all those that voted 3 party made up the most votes against a sitting president ever.
