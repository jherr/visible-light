Today Megan and I went to Target to get Sadie&apos;s insulin.  While we waited for the prescription to be filled, we wandered around and enjoyed some &apos;OpUn&apos; (Popcorn)  after a few handfuls Megan asked me for juice (her word for all beverages).  I handed her her sippy cup and said Megan&apos;s juice.  She thought for a moment, looked at my soda cup , pointed at it and said &quot;Ahmi&apos;s Juice&quot;  

Later at lunch when I put her plate in front of her I said here you go Megan&apos;s Dinner and she pointed to my plate and said &quot;Ahmi&apos;s Dinah&quot;  She then looked over to Jack&apos;s empty chair and said &quot;Dada no Dinah&quot;

Just a week ago, it was just simple words and now we have whole thoughts and sentences!
