 [Once again, i witnessed tragedy.](http://www.insidebayarea.com/argus/localnews/ci_12470006)   This time though I was there just after, but I saw them load an unconscience woman onto an ambulance as I sat at the near by light.  I saw that there were several other people being attended to by paramedics.   The SUV was wrapped around the tree.  I headed on to my appointment and didn&apos;t think much of it accept to be grateful it wasn&apos;t me.  When I came back by the Firetrucks and ambulances were gone but the police were there and they were photographing everything, and taking measurements.  I knew if my gut someone had died.   Oh how I wish I was wrong.
