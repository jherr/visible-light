Megan and I are heading home today.  We&apos;ve had a great time here in Florida, and we&apos;ll miss grandpa and grandpa&apos;s pool.  We&apos;ll miss the puppies that are smaller than Megan.  but we won&apos;t miss the heat and humidity.  

We&apos;ll also be glad to be getting home to Ripley Sadie and Jack.  There is no place like home.
