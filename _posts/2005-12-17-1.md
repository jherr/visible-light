we have two feeders in our yard, one out front and one out back.  The one in the back is never full, I fill it and the squirrels have a party.  It gets empty so fast, i tend to give up on it.  The one in front though takes forever to empty, dangling from a hook the squirrels to heavy to hold on and the holes too small for them to access the feed.  this morning I watched as 5 little birds all fought over the two holes on the bottom, because they have finally eaten enough that the holes on the top have no seed.  I&apos;ll have to buy more seed, good stuff for the front, and cheap stuff for the back, and maybe a new feeder out back, on that dangles from a hook so we can feed the birds as well as the squirrels.
