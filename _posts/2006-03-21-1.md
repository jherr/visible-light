Megan and I ventured down to Monterey yesterday.   We invited  [Megan&apos;s sitter along us](http://jeanetta-lucier.livejournal.com/)  and she&apos;s beat me to blogging about it.

The day started out rainy, and traffic was backed up worse than usual.  It took us about an hour longer to get down there.  Once there we dodged raindrops and went in and explored the Aquarium.  Megan tends to run through exhibits, but by the third I was able to slow her down a bit.  There were alot of docents working and one in the jellies as art exhibit showed us the the polyps in one tank.  basically the polyp which starts out as a fertilized egg, is attached to a hard surface and has several layers each one pops off and becomes a baby jelly.  We finished up the morning in the Outer Bay before heading out to  [Blue Moon](http://bluemoonmonterey.com/index.htm)  for a yummy lunch. While waiting for our food we watch the usual otters and birds and then, we got to see a whole pod of wild dolphins swim by - it was very cool. 

Back at the Aquarium, we explored the other side. By now the place had gotten very crowded. But it was still alot of fun and Megan of course loved the water play area. 

The ride home was much smoother, and we even saw a double complete rainbow - which was also very cool.
