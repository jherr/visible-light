Megan and I are supposed to go get her car seat check out today at 10am, however I scheduled it over a month ago and now she has a set schedule which involoves a nap at 9-930 which usually last 2 hours.  so now I need to post-pone the appoinment.  I like the morning nap its nice and long - I can get stuff done, or read, or nap myself.  After very little sleep last night I need a nap today.  Not sure why but i really didn&apos;t sleep much last night, I looked at the clock each time I woke up and it was basically every hour or so that I looked at the clock.  I&apos;m sure gymboree today is going to wipe me out.
