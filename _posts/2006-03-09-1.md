one of my guilty pleasures is  [Project Runway](http://www.bravotv.com/Project_Runway_2/)  and I&apos;m so happy that Chloe won it.  Her collection was beautiful - so refined and cohesive.  I had thought I hated it, based on the little snippets I saw online and in the episodes leading up to it.  I&apos;m so glad I was wrong.  I didn&apos;t really like Daniel&apos;s finished collection - it was pretty overall but little details on most of the pieces ruined them, like the patch that the judges wanted to rip off.  And Santino - what to say about him, his collection while I thought would be my favorite based on the teaser trailers, turned out to be boring and didn&apos;t fit the models.  I was glad the judges called him on it.

It was also nice to get teary eyed with Chloe&apos;s success.  She really did a beautiful job. 

Now I just need to wait for Season 3!
