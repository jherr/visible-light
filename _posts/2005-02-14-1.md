Film club yesterday showed a hysterical film which I couldn&apos;t watch.  The movie was  [The Delicate Art of Parking](http://www.thedelicateartofparking.com/)  and while the dialogue was very funny and kept me laughing, but the camera was so shaky I was nauseous throughout the flick, and watched it from behind my hands.

The film tells the story of the parking enforcement officers, a job we all love to hate.  If your not effected by motion, and they ever release it in the US, I recommend it.  If however, your like me you&apos;ll either need dramamine to see it on the big screen or you should wait for the DVD and watch it on the smallest tv in your house.
