Summer is flying by.  School will be here before we know it, and I am just not ready for that!  

We just got back from an extended weekend in Sonoma where we saw good friends marry, and then Megan and I came home via Muir Woods where she once again attained Junior Ranger Status.  We also enjoyed a great though long hike and came home tired out.

Wednesday we went hiking/exploring Garin Park in Hayward which is beautiful and i&apos;m ashamed to say I&apos;ve never been too before!  I was actually too tired for hiking and so we took a stroll.  

Megan is off today to a friends for 2 nights sleep over.  We have been hiking with another family regularly and I&apos;ve got some pictures for you.  I&apos;m going to put them all up in one place and link it rather then load each one here - which will only allow me to do it one at a time.   ![](/images/assets/IMG_1722-thumb-600x800-152.jpg) 

on the craft front - I&apos;ve been sketching a bit -really glad I took that travel journaling class in Yosemite.  I&apos;ve also started converting all my t-shirt which I never wear to v-necks and I love them!  I just cut out the collar, making the front a v and then surge the edges to make the straight and finished.  I actually bought a shirt at Muir woods just to do this too.  I&apos;m also making another bag for myself.  I purchased white place mats and plan on tie dying them and then sewing them into a bag like I did before. <br />
