We&apos;re home.  It was a long but good week.  Megan enjoyed time with her grandpa and her pappa and grandma Pat.  She loved Uncle Doodlebug and Aunt Missy and Justin, I don&apos;t think she ever noticed her cousin Elise.  

A special thanks to Elton and Pat for giving us a cosy place to sleep during such a hectic time.  I hope we weren&apos;t too much of a bother.  

More later once I&apos;ve slept.
