last friday I went and finally got a flu shot.  So I&apos;m protected on that front (or will be in a week to 14 days).

Sunday I went to a class on Hot Glass - making a paper weight which I will post pictures of late in, but it was so interesting to get to make something with liquid glass that was 2000 degrees!

Sunday Night I started feeling peculiar and woke up MOnday with a stomach bug.  No idea what caused it.  But I&apos;m finding Ginger ale and Saltines about all I want to eat 24 hours later.

The stomach bug is probably why I spaced on THe puppies Vet Appt for shots.
