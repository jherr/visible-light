Monday turned out nothing as planned.  We still got together with our friends and the kids played and played, but both requested to play over the movie and so we did that, we also ended up eating at our friends house other than going out to lunch.  We did get the kids out to a park and then over to our house for some more play time.  

Today after I swam my mile, I went to Jack&apos;s office to pick up Megan who was watching a movie and eating breakfast.  I loaded her up in the car and we drove down to Monterey to get another glimpse of the great white shark... only They released him just this morning, we still enjoyed the fairly empty aquarium, with the exception of a couple of school groups.  We had a nice lunch at Blue Moon our usual Monterey haunt and got to watch some seals that were on rocks right under the restaurant window.
 
I had my mom&apos;s club board meeting tonight and overall I&apos;m exhausted, but not sure I&apos;m ready to sleep.
