Jack is 40 today.  He&apos;s already gone to bed but I think he had a pretty good evening.  And the festivities continue tomorrow - we are meeting a bunch of friends at a restaurant.  The kids (Megan and some friends kids) will decorate a cake while we&apos;re at dinner.  Tonight Jack Megan and I went out to dinner and then came home for presents.  Earlier Jack had a massage while Megan and I went and saw Journey to the Center to the Earth - which she just loved.  Only the T-Rex really freaked her out and that is a short scene.  She loved the 3D effects and it was so much fun watching her.
