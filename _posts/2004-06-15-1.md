Megan and I were just out playing in the sprinkler and I noticed the bird flying in and out of its nest.  Its alot more active during the day than night.  In the evening its been pretty active so we thought it was an owl, but now I&apos;m thinking its a falcon.  Its mostly white, with some grey and black on the tips of its wings.  I still haven&apos;t gotten a good look at its face.  Any ideas?
