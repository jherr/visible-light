We biked today along the bay in Alameda (a city north of us)  we drove up, searched for parking, and then headed over to crab cove on our bikes - and then south along the bay trail .  We went over the draw bridge and along the bay behind the Oakland airport.  We stopped to rest, drink water and take in the view before heading back the way we came.  All told about 10 miles.  

Its been a great summer   - last weekend we went camping to Portola Redwoods State Park and since then Megan and I went down to Monterey Bay Aquarium.   I love this state!<br />
