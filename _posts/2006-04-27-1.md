Megan wanted her toes painted tonight.  Its another thing I didn&apos;t realize I&apos;d be as a mom - Beautician :)  I&apos;m not the best at hair but i&apos;m getting better - my pigtails are even sometimes even and equal.  To keep her still while I painted and they dried I put on &quot;Jo Jo&apos;s Circus.&quot;  

I asked Megan if she liked Jo Jo and she said yes.  I asked her if she wanted to watch it before naps instead of Max & Ruby and she said &quot;No&quot;... why I asked...

Well it turns out Max & Ruby a comic about a brother and sister Rabbit always has 3 stories.  Jo Jo only comes in 2&apos;s.  ...!

 So Megan feels like she&apos;s getting more out of Max &Ruby even though they are both 30 minutes.
