I can&apos;t comment on my own blog, because when Jack updated my OS to OS10.3 last week it erased on my preset passwords etc from Safari.  Type Key is case sensitive and I can&apos;t figure out what I used as a login name.  I never gave them a hint to recover the password so the recovery route doesn&apos;t work and because there is already an account with my email address I can&apos;t just get a new one.  Its a circle.
