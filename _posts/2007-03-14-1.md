No i didn&apos;t go to the doctor - probably should but what are they going to say - I&apos;m now at the dry unproductive annoying cough stage.  I managed to get to the pool this morning and I swam 2 lengths before I gave up because of excessive coughing and just used the kick board and kicked for 20 mins.  then I got out and soaked in the hot tub.  It felt ok but not wonderful.  Last night I managed to do yoga and not cough much.  My friend has a bi-weekly yoga night at her house and I went and really enjoyed myself.  I hope to continue going.
