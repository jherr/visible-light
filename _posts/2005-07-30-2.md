i&apos;m enjoying my first coffee/slushie of the day and Megan and I are watching &quot;shrek&quot;  we&apos;ll she&apos;s watching i&apos;m snoozing, drinking and blogging through it.

It hurts like hell to swallow fluid, so I can&apos;t even imagine eating ever again!

A dear friend left me a Jamba Juice gift card in our mail box and i&apos;m looking forward to something yummy and smooth from them.
