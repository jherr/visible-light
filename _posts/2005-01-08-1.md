I drove to West Sacramento this morning.  After the 2 hour drive in and out of rain bands, I meet Roscoe a very sweet boy - he&apos;s a lab great dane mix with the head of a dane and the body of a lab.  His bigger than a lab but not as big as a dane.  Anyway he gave me a kiss and enjoyed getting scratched.  He seems like a great catch - have to wonder how he ended up needing to be rescued. 

So tomorrow we&apos;re to meet one more possibility and then we&apos;ll decide on one of them or keep looking.
