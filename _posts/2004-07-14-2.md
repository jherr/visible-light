So I switched over to the new commenting and well now no one can comment.  Jack promises to figure it out, but I don&apos;t think he&apos;ll have time until ... who knows when.  So you can&apos;t attack my political blogs.  :)

so much to do to get ready to leave and I&apos;m hosting a scrap booking night for some mom friends instead.  Looking forward to sitting down and sorting through photos.  Can&apos;t believe I&apos;m a scrap booker!  Megan will love having these albums when she&apos;s older though - As the baby of 5 all I got was a manilla envelope with snapshots and a empty baby book.
