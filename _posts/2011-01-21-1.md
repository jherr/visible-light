We have internet! and TV! and phone - finally! - a whole week without - had to resort to reading and listening to the radio - so retro.  

We moved - We have listed our old house, and we just went to Megan&apos;s school for a sock hop.  The house smells like burnt pizza from trying to use 2 stones at once and I&apos;ve been exhausted for the last week. 

Oh and now I bike 4 miles in the morning and 4 miles in the afternoon to take Megan too and from school.  My legs are getting muscle definition.  

Oso loves the new house cause it has carpet - though he worked on destroying the kitchen door tonight.

I&apos;m falling asleep as I type this so I&apos;ll sign off - <br />
