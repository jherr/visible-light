If you like the ride at Disney, you&apos;ll enjoy the movie.  They really did a good job of keeping all the parts of the ride in the story.  On its own the movie has a good story mixed with alot of special effects .  I think the whole thing lasted too long - like the didn&apos;t dare throw any of the special effect squences.

One of the previews before the movie was for another disney ride - the Haunted Mansion - it too looked true to the ride - complete with hitch hiking ghosts.  What&apos;s next the hall of Presidents? or how about Its a small world?
