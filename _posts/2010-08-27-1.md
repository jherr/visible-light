This past week, after a very cold summer we finally got up into the 80&apos;s and even once we hit 90.  I never thought I would welcome hot weather.  Megan and I took advantage and have spent 2 days at the pool and one day at the beach.  Some pictures are up at  [Shutterfly - Muttmansion](http://muttmansion.shutterfly.com/)   but here&apos;s one of my California Girl.

Included in the shots are ones from LA, Our clean House experience and going to the American Girl Cafe. 

Summer has just flown by.  School starts next week and we will be in Disneyland for a weekend in September.   <br />
