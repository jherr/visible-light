I&apos;m going to avoid more politics on Facebook, but this article was too good not to share.  And that is what my blog is for :)

 [&quot;How I lost Faith in the Pro-Life Movement&quot;](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2012/10/how-i-lost-faith-in-the-pro-life-movement.html) 

This is similar to my thoughts - I&apos;ve long thought abortion is between a woman and her doctor but that I personally could never have one.  The real answer is birth control.  And the people who are the most vocal on this issue (Pro-Life) tend to also be anti birth control.  It is so counter intuitive.
