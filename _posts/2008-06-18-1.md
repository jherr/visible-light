As a person this  [story is about, ](http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/living/2008/06/18/chodak.co.bumper.stickers.cnn) I think its utter bullshit.  I do love my car and plan on driving it until it dies, but that has little to do with the many bumper stickers on the back.  I&apos;m so not going to defend my car - that just isn&apos;t me.  

Its funny the responses I get from my bumper sticker wall.  I get lots of thumbs up and honks and smiles.  That is the majority, but every once and a while I get a birdie or someone races ahead of me to cut me off and then drives really slow - those are the people that suffer from road rage.
