I tivo&apos;d the AMC original movie  [Broken Trail](http://brokentrail.amctv.com/) .  Since it was a western I figured Jack would like it but I never really  cared for the genre.  Last night we finally started watching it and with in 20 minutes I was finishing up my online card game and closing my laptop.

We watched the first half and well its really well done - I can&apos;t believe a made for TV and and cable channel is so well acted and made.  When the first 2 hours ended we quickly agreed to just keep watching, though it would mean a late night.  Then we discovered I&apos;d Tivo&apos;d part one twice.

Bummer :)  ... so we search and found another airing. .. but not for a week - why doesn&apos;t AMC repeat at nauseam like ever other cable channel.  So if you get AMC get ready for on the 7th they are playing it as a 4 hour block.  If you don&apos;t get the channel call you cable company and order it - you&apos;ve got a weeks notice.
