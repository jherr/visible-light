Today was walk and roll to school day and it followed on the heals of our first rip roaring winter storm.  So we biked dodging rain drops and sprinklers.  This after a fairly sleepless night thanks to thunder, wind and a dog who can&apos;t handle either.    He finally calmed down around 1:30 thanks to closing the windows and giving him a calm down drug.  I love the big guy but some times he is the biggest pain in the a$$.

Today, Jack&apos;s nephew is coming to town for a job interview - so I have to get the guest room ready, and continue my halloween decoration prep - I&apos;m looking for 2 planter urns, any color as I can spray paint them black.  I have spanish moss to put in them, and some long sticks to add to the creepy factor.  This on top of 2 tombstones that Jack cut out of plywood, spray painted and I deco-podged on sayings.  I&apos;d like a couple more but they are a bit of work.

I might how ever hold off on everything until I can nap.  Damn I&apos;m tired today.<br />
