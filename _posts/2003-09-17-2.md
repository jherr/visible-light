Megan and I enjoyed Borders Union City Story time today.  The story teller, read 3 stories including where the wild things are, we sang several songs, Itsy bitsy etc and then we got a free cookie.  When she&apos;s older she&apos;ll get to draw too - can&apos;t believe its all free - of course I did buy a dvd.
