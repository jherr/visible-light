Tonight at 6, we just started wondering about what was for dinner.  Jack&apos;s been under the weather the last couple of days so I didn&apos;t want to just make anything - I wanted to see what he felt like.  He decided he could do Pasta, so I agreed.  I went out to the garden to get some tomatoes for a salad and some basil for the sauce.   Our Basil is amazing - due to our heat wave - its really been taking off. We&apos;re usually so cool that we don&apos;t get huge basil plants.  Anyway - I picked a whole branch and headed in.  I didn&apos;t really feel like tomato sauce.  So I decided I&apos;d make pesto for me and mix the pesto with some tomato sauces for Jack and Megan.  I had Jack pick some more tomatoes so I could mix them in with the pesto  and pasta for me - and wow - so yummy.  Jack and Megan gobbled up their dinner to so I think we had a winner.    I have a whole jar of pesto in the fridge left over too - yum

I love picking fresh from the garden and cooking incredible food on a moments notice.
