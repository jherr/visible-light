I strolled in to my favorite clothing store today in search of a couple more bra&apos;s since living with just two is starting to drive me batty.  They are having a sale on the style I like but in odd colors  So now I&apos;m a colorful person, inside and out... Purple, light green and orange.  I&apos;ll be sure to wear the orange one next time the canes play - in August.
