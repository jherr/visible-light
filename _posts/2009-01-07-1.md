So our dryer died.  One of the first things I did when it did was search my blog to figure out when I bought it.  And for once the blog failed me - it was such an insignificant event that I hadn&apos;t blogged it or it happened before I started blogging... either way it was the first time the blog had failed me as a memory keeper.  And so now I&apos;m planning on mentioning more mundane things just so google can organize my brain and there will be a record of what I did when  - Seriously!  Don&apos;t believe me???? new dryer arrives this friday January 9th :)
