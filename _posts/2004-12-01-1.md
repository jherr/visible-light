Thom helped me figure out how to put on my tire chains and with a trip to the store for munchies, Megan and I are all set for our trip back friday.  Baring a setback at the vet tomorrow we&apos;ll pull out of here around 9 am and try to drive through to Eugene.  

Today we&apos;re going tree hunting with the Bolduc&apos;s and then tomorrow we&apos;re going to check out the Walla Walla Children&apos;s Museum.  Then tomorrow after noon Sadie will have a blood check.
