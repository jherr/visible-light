Oh how I love Nordstroms, and what&apos;s not to love.  After going to 2 Macy&apos;s, a Lane Bryant, Avenue and a Catherine&apos;s yesterday I was pretty much over the idea of getting a dress for Saturday, but today I took Megan to Stoneridge and started at Nordstroms and had 15 dresses to try on with in a few minutes.  I picked a really pretty simple silk dress with a cover up that was on Sale!, and then I found a pair of black strappy sandals to go with it.  Megan also got 2 new pairs of shoes, a pair of black shoes and a pair of white sandals.  We then had lunch at CPK ASAP and a lovely drive back.
