Texas&apos;s new law preventing gay and lesbians from fostering is so full of ignorance and hate.  Kids in the system, who&apos;ve never known a home are told that they can&apos;t be loved but this group of people, even if they are willing and able.  There are way to many kids in the system who age outm never living in a home and feeling the love of a family. 

Most child sexual assault is perpetrated by men who are heterosexual and do not find sex with other men at all attractive. Many child molesters abuse both boys and girls.

I am unfortunately not shocked because this ignorance is becoming the norm in our society and this hatred toward people for their sexual preference has become acceptable.  This is just plan wrong.

On a slighly side note -  [Bill Maher](http://www.hbo.com/billmaher/?ntrack_para1=feat_sec2_image)  had a great line last friday on his show... something to the effect of ... if your against gay marriage than don&apos;t go - they don&apos;t want you there anyway.   How true... If people aren&apos;t accepting of me for who I am than I don&apos;t really want them in my life... and certainly not at any of life&apos;s great events - like my wedding!
