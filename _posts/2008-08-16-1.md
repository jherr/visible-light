We&apos;re keeping an eye on Tropical Storm Fay - she&apos;s heading straight for us here in Florida and we are scheduled to go home Wednesday.  Though we have been having a great visit, we both miss Jack and the dogs so much we don&apos;t want our trip home delayed.

The Cousins all headed to South Florida last week so Megan and went down to Orlando for a night and enjoyed  [Medieval Times](http://www.medievaltimes.com/) .  We rooted for the Black and White Knight and he even threw a flower at Megan.    Here are 8 pictures from the night - one of our knight and the rest of our girl (well one of me with her)  she had a great time till our Knight got his butt kicked then she seemed a bit bored - until the prince came back and defeated the evil knight and then all was right with the world.

Then we spent the night in a hotel before spending the next day at Magic Kingdom - More on that later.
