I know its been 6 months since I&apos;ve blogged.  Facebook usually gets my stories.  Its getting chilly.  I&apos;m loving the lights and the nip on my nose.  

Sewing a skirt for Megan.  Black one for choir - something other than pink for my girl. 

Missing mom though - Every ornament I got from her over the years was hung on the tree with a story to those who would listen.  She loved Christmas.   Its a tough time of the year to lose someone you love.  

A good friend of mine just lost her husband this weekend, also a good friend.  Marty had been fighting ALS  for sometime.  Terrible disease.  But her strength and his such an inspiration.  Love to them.  Wish we lived closer.
