Last night I was cutting out fabric in front of the tv (i&apos;m making an apron for an apron exchange - i&apos;ll take a picture of the lucky recipient and post it later.)  I was watching Monday&apos;s Studio 60 which is a flawed but enjoyable show (flawed because I just don&apos;t buy the whole Southern Baptist Comedian willing to poke fun at her faith on the SNL like show and they keep reminding us of her ubber faith which makes it more unbelievable) Anyway - the musical guest in the show within a show was Corinne Bailey Rae who I had never heard of before - but her music was  memorizing, so I ran over to Itunes and downloaded her album and now its my music.  Her voice is so beautiful so haunting  - [ check her out.](http://www.corinnebaileyrae.net/)
