I&apos;m 34 years old today.  I feel no different then yesterday when I was 33.  Isn&apos;t that typical.  I&apos;m not sure where I thought I&apos;d be at this point in my life, but I know I&apos;m where I want to be now.  That is living with Jack, my other half, and Megan my wonderful darling daughter. 

Jack and I are going out tonight leaving Megan with the babysitter &quot;neeta&quot;  When I told her this morning that the babysitter was coming over, she said &quot;no Neeta No neeta NO NO NO!&quot;  

I&apos;m sure we&apos;re in for tears tonight - after all she&apos;s my daughter and I used to cry till i threw up when ever a mom and dad hired a babysitter.
