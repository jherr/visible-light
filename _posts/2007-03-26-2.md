I managed to swim a mile today, and I do mean managed.  I&apos;m still coughing a bit and after a couple of weeks of being really sick I&apos;ve just lost my stamina.  I know i&apos;ll get it back but it is a bit off putting.

You know what&apos;s annoying - having a small wet dog who insists on sitting on your shoulders and neck  I know he&apos;s cold from his shivering but still he&apos;s wet! and I push him off and turn around and he climbs right back on to my shoulders.
