Occasionally I end up with a sunburn.  Before Megan when we went to Hawaii it was on my legs above the knees.  In Australia after seeing Agassi play Courier it was in the scalp.  

I&apos;d been pretty sun smart since Megan was born, helped in part by the fact that I lather her in sunscreen so I have it on hand.  Yesterday we had a lovely day at the Santa Cruz Beach with Megan&apos;s friends Audrey and Oliver, and and their siblings, and  mom&apos;s Malai and Gretchen.  The weather was perfect.  I was the only one who went into the water - which on this coast is freezing.   The kids absolutely loved playing in the sand.  We all enjoyed a picnic lunch and Malai was brave enough to take all the kids to the boardwalk for Ice Cream.

I managed to cover most of my body with sunscreen, but missed my upper back and my new suit leaves it exposed.  I am now suffering for it.  Megan is fine, as I liberally applied and reapplied sunscreen to her. 

The other part of me that got too much sun was my arm - driver side - and while I got sunscreen on it at the beach, it got a little dark on the trip down- so much so that my left arm is several shades darker than my right.
