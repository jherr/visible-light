 [We got her just over 3 years ago today.](/vl/archives/002847.html)   Just this morning we discovered our dear friend fish had died.  We laid her to rest in a small jewelry box and buried her next to the fence in our new watermelon patch.  Megan made a small sign and put flowers on her grave.  Tear were shed, and Megan said a few words including telling us how much she will miss her friend.
