I noticed on my walk back home today that a family up the block has a yes on 8 sign in their yard.  What makes this fascinating to me is that the couple who&apos;ve I&apos;ve meet several times, chatted with and even helped when I was running the  [spay/neuter program for the humane society ](http://www.ohlonehumanesociety.org) , is of mixed race.  He is black - african from Ghana I believe actually and she is white.  

<a href=&quot;http://www.kqed.org/w/baywindow/othercolors/changingtimes/index.html&quot;>1880	California prohibits the issuance of licenses for marriage between a white person and &quot;a Negro, mulatto, or Mongolian.&quot;

1909	California passes a law specifically adding the Japanese to the list of those barred from marrying whites.

1945	California Assembly Bill SB 321, signed by Gov. Earl Warren, prohibits marriage between whites and &quot;Negroes, mulattos, Mongolians, and Malays&quot;.

1948	In Perez vs. Sharp, the California Supreme Court rules against anti-miscegenation laws, stating that they were based on racial distinctions that were &quot;by their very nature, odious to a free people&quot;. The U.S. Supreme Court rules that race-restrictive housing covenants are unconstitutional. As Japanese Americans move into integrated neighborhoods, increased social interaction leads to more intermarriage.</a>

So 60 years ago they got the right to marry and now they want to take it away from someone else.  Unbelievable! How spiteful can you get.
