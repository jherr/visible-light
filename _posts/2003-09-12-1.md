Megan is loving her elmo and really any other charecter on SS.  I got a laugh yesterday when on Elmo&apos;s World Elmo was watching clothes TV and the announce said next time on Clothes TV Socks and the City - a play on Sex and the City - oh Sesame Street - sort of shocked me and then made me giggle.  No kid would get it but a few mom&apos;s and dad&apos;s out there got a laugh. - Nice
