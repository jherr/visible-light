On the way to the grocery store today I passed a Gas station with gas at $4.06, I didn&apos;t think anything of it until the next light where one station was $4.15 and the other was $4.23.  I went back and got the $4.06.  When I left the grocery store the  $4.15 was now $4.23, surprisingly the first station was still $4.06.  Even later on when Megan and I were coming back from her Ice Skating lesson it was still $4.06.

I bet tomorrow they will catch up.
