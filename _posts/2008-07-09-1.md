Driving from Megan&apos;s camp to our pool the last 2 days I&apos;ve been driving down Mission Blvd in Hayward, which is one of those stretches of road full car lots both used and new.  I&apos;ve been amazed that a lot of the lots are full of SUV&apos;s.  Didn&apos;t the used car dealers see the writing on the wall - I can&apos;t believe they have been buying them up, because with gas around 4.60 a gallon - no one wants to drive them.

I have noticed that those that are still driving SUV&apos;s are driving more and more  with their windows down - Like that will bring them fuel efficiency!
