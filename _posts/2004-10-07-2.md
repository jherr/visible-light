Megan and I had a lovely day.  We went to the Palo Alto Children&apos;s Museum and zoo where we saw Rats and Bats, turtles and Fish, Geese and Ducks, a hawk and raccoons.  She tried saying the names of everything today which was alot of fun.  

We then had Lunch at CPK with another mom and her son, before heading to the grocery store on the way home.  It was wonderful to have a fun day out after a week of being sick.  And it was wonderful to escape &quot;EMO!&quot;
