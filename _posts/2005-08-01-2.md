With Jack going back to work tomorrow, i&apos;ve been stressed about the open house for Megan&apos;s preschool.  How I was going to drive her over when I can&apos;t even get out of bed for long enough to do anything.  Well the lovely director just called and postpone the open house till the 12th... that gives me plenty of time to recover and means Megan and I can hang out at the house all day, watching movies, etc.  And I don&apos;t have to drive anywhere.
