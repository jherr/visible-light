Jack is up baking the cinnamon buns, and I&apos;m up cause well the alarm went off twice and Oso has been moaning.   Did I mention that Oso is a moaner... like a cat purrs ... its off the hook funny.  

I peeked earlier and Santa did indeed come.  Jack and I took a few pictures before Megan wakes up and attacks.  I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll have them up soon.  Our plan is simple.... Megan gets up and then we&apos;ll let her see what Santa brought,  have some breakfast and start in on the pile o gifts under the tree.

Its supposed to rain today, but if it doesn&apos;t we&apos;ll probably walk down to the park, and drop off some goodies along the way.  I managed to give away alot of my baking, including a lb of the fudge.

Anyway - as Megan would say Merry Mismiss to all!
