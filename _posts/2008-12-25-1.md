We&apos;ve had a lovely day.  The morning started with Jack and Megan delivering some cinnamon buns to a friend while I got her hamster out and into its ball and wrapped with tissue paper.  I threw a blanket over her cage and Megan came in to find the paper ball rolling all around!  The one hiccup was the dogs - mostly Oso who once he saw the hamster was absolutely obsessed with it.  On the plus that meant he wasn&apos;t paying attention to his own neuroses.  

We then sat around opening gifts while Oso drooled beneath the now very high hamster cage.  

After a day of chilling, watching a movie, playing games etc.  I prepared a decadent dinner of Prime Rib with Thyme Au Jus, Pan Seared Brussels Sprouts with Bacon and Onions, Scalloped Potatoes, Caesar Salad, and Jack made bread rolls!.  Everything was scrumptious and the Brussels sprouts were the absolute best I&apos;ve ever had!

Kitchen is cleaned.  And we have a night in front of the fire planned.
