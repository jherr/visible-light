So its all set.  When Megan woke up  from her nap we headed up  to  hang with Pam and Yvonne and then she&apos;ll spend the night. Then I&apos;m up early for a 7:30 surgery time.  I like my doctor and I&apos;ve read enough to know i&apos;ll be ok, but i&apos;m still nervous.  I can&apos;t sleep, but is that really surprising?  I&apos;ll blog when I can and I&apos;m sure  [Jack](http://www.muttmansion.com/ds)  will keep anyone posted that wants updates.
