I&apos;ve been giving quilting a try since I visited Mumsy and Grandpa in Florida.  I made 4 placemats first.  Well Mumsy worked through one in Ocala and the other 3 I did when we got back.  While buying supplies I found a quilt kit for a kids blanket.  It uses lots of soft fabrics, including satin, flannel, cotton and plush.  Well damn if Plush isn&apos;t the worst possible fabric to quilt with.  

While the cotton, flannel and satin all stay put, the plush stretches.  It was alright while I was sewing all the squares together, but now that i&apos;m sewing the plush back to the top Damn if I can&apos;t get it all to line up - the plush squares are on the four corners and when I start at one corner and sew straight down - no matter how many pins I put in the plush at the other end ends up longer than the bottom piece.  I think the bottom plush stays put cause I already attached the batting.  

Anyway - After ripping out stitches a few times, you sort of just decide the hell with it - I&apos;m going just finish it and forget about ever using plush again.   I need to move on - I have a costume to make!

On the plus - I love my cutting table - however I really don&apos;t have room for it - We need another 2 rooms I think to really be comfortable.
