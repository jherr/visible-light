its 9 am and Megan hasn&apos;t made a peep, not a stir.  Yesterday Pam and Yvonne came down while Josephine and Megan played we took turns seeing  [ The Island ](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/island/)  which was enjoyable entertainment.  Megan and Josephine apparently swam hard and ate lunch while Pam and I were gone because when we got back they were both napping.  Jack and Yvonne headed out and Josephine woke up like over an hour later.  Megan shortly followed.  Then after Thai dinner the parents played a fun game of poker (fun meaning free) and Yvonne who was first out of the table wrangled the girls in the bath.  Megan was actually asleep soon after I put her down at 9 which given the nap I just didn&apos;t expect.  ...so now its 9 am and she&apos;s still asleep.  I love it when those 2 get to play.
