In an effort to reduce our &quot;Carbon Footprint&quot;, I went out and bought a </a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hills_Hoist&quot;> hills hoist </a>- the aussie term for &quot;rotary clothes line&quot;.  I&apos;ve managed to dry a few loads with it, and noticed the towels now scratch my back nicely.  But as I put my flannel PJ bottoms on last night I realized I needed help - how do you make fabric like Terry Cloth and flannel not scratch the skin off when they haven&apos;t been machine dried?  My legs (and other areas) would appreciate any input you may have. 

The funny thing is I did use one of these before during the  [The California Energy Crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_electricity_crisis)  but as soon as the Crisis passed I threw the darn thing in the shed until we cleaned out the shed and I sent it to the dump.  Now I&apos;ve bought another - with the mind that I would use it during the summer as my primary dryer.  But I can&apos;t for the life of me remember how I made the towels enjoyable- with out using the electric dryer.
