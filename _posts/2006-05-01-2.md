BUSH declared Mission Accomplished... remember that fiasco.   [2335 US soldiers have died since he stood on the ship.](http://icasualties.org/oif/) 

And never forget the lies that brought us to war in the first place.  There were NO WMD&apos;s.  

Its easy to forget about what&apos;s happening over there, when the sun is shinning and we&apos;re all having such a good time.
