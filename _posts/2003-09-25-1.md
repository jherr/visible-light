So I don&apos;t know if you know this about me but I answer surveys.  I don&apos;t know why but I love them.  I&apos;m not talking fill in the blank and mail in I&apos;m talking gallop poll call me up and promise from the begning that I don&apos;t have to pay anything, just answer questions about current affairs.  Well tonghit was all about the Oct 7th election, who I liked and who I didn&apos;t like, so when the come out with the next set of statics, I&apos;m in the voting no on the recall group, I&apos;m voting for Cruz B.
