Today was Megan&apos;s actual birthday.  It started a lot like our party day.  Megan and I went to Little Gym for our gym class.  Then we went next door to ToysRUs to get a gift for a party tomorrow (that I just realized we can go because Megan has her check up then).  Megan then said Fish go fish so we went to the pet store and looked at fish, birds and hamsters.  We met a little jack russell named &quot;Ed&quot; who Megan completely ignored. We finished up the birthday celebrations tonight with Megan&apos;s favortie dinner &quot;ahmi&apos;s Pitza&quot; and then Megan decorated her own cake I&apos;d baked earlier with gel icing, blew out another candle and then enjoyed the cake.

After her bath we gave her another gift.  Jack and I gave her  [Little Red](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000096LKJ/qid=1098762631/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/102-4923500-4664142) , which she was instantly in love with.  She even took it to bed tonight and when we sang songs and rocked she cuddled with Little Red.  The doll just reminded me of an old fashion rag doll. No Plastic or batteries, just soft cloth and cuddles.  If I sewed I could have made her one, but alas I&apos;m not that good.
