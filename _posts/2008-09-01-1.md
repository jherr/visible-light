I actually owe several blogs, like the rest of our trip to Orlando or our trip in Florida.  I also have been meaning to blog about Megan&apos;s first week of first grade or that I have decided  to run for  secretary of our schools PTC (same as PTA but not official or affiliated with PTAs).  Basically we&apos;ve just been too busy.  

I&apos;ve really gotten into sewing full force.  I&apos;m currently finishing up some quilted placemats that Mumsy started me on while in Fl.  Next up is a quilt Megan wants, though I may have to sideline that to make her costume since Halloween is 2 months away.    I also found some really pretty purple fabric with butterflies in it - that I want to make a bag or something out of for myself.   - I bought 2 yards so maybe something else since a bag really doesn&apos;t need that much fabric.
