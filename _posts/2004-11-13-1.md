Megan woke up crying at 5:40.  Sadie was elated as she really really needed to walk bad.  I&apos;m not entirely sure Sadie didn&apos;t bump the crib to get us moving.  I showed her .. I took a shower first :)

On our way back in we stopped in the breakfast room and got juice, coffee and circles (cherrios) where I was told no dogs allowed - this being my third La Quinta this was the first time I was told NO DOG ALLOWED in that room.  I&apos;m not thrilled with this location anyway, there is only a small patch of weeds and garbage next to the high way  that is the dog&apos;s only area to walk.  I didn&apos;t insist on a non-smoking room and really it didn&apos;t matter til I climbed into bed and I realized the pillows and mattress smelled.  This morning I used the last towel from the bottom stack and it smelled like cigarettes.   Overall its a fine hotel, its the little things that annoy and make me choose not to stay here again.  On our way back we&apos;ll stay at one of the other La Quinta&apos;s.

Now to pack up and head out.  Honestly I don&apos;t have any reason to doddle.  We&apos;ll probably be on the road by 8 once I pack up, walk Sadie again, Load the car and pay the bill.

Walla Walla here we come.
