Saw the movie &quot;the Family Stone&quot; tonight.  and while I really thought over all it was a great flick, I was annoyed that no one not even the previews or the reviewers thought clueing me in (yes its all about me) that it was a movie about loosing ones mom around christmas, was a good idea.  It hit really too close to home for comfort, and while I can always use a good cry, its nice to be prepared.  

It was funny at times, but more often than not it was filled with those moments where you tear up and don&apos;t say enough.
