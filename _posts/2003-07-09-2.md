Ok now bush and his minions have gone to far.  In an increased war on drugs effort they are going after bongs and head shops - like there isn&apos;t enough on their plate.  I&apos;m so sick of the wasted money on the war of drugs - it doesn&apos;t work, it crowds our prisions and wastes tax money for a failed war.  

Enough already! - rant now over.
