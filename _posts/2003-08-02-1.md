Once again insomnia stricks.  I&apos;m typing this at 6:25 am after finally falling asleep around 12:30 and waking up periodically through the night.  Part of the trouble this am is that I&apos;m starving - that pain in your head kind of starving, the glass of water  came to bed with just isn&apos;t cutting it.  (Megan&apos;s was starting to stir  , must be typing loudly - so now picture me siting in the sqeeky old rope bed with laptop in lap on pillow and blanket pulled over both of us!)

I think we are off to silver springs today Glass bottom boats and lots of animals.  After everyone leaves tomorrow I&apos;m going to take Megan to the Market of Marion for some grade A people watching (big flea market).
