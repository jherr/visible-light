Actually rain is what I miss most about Florida.  While it rains in California during the winter, it just doesn&apos;t rain enough for my taste.  I need rain to cleanse my soul.  It makes everything feel fresh and new. I would love to live in a place that has a liberal political current, an open and accepting policy for all people and comfortable year round cool temps - like the bay area, and yet has rain fall on at least a weekly basis, with thunder and lightning to cuddle under a big blanket and watch movies.

If you know of a place - let me know.
