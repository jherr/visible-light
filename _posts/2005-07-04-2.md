Because fireworks are legal ... &quot;safe and Sane&quot; ones and our entire neighbor hood sounds a war zone, and Sadie is scared, and Oso is freaking so much we had to slip him a tranquilizer (from his getting nails done collection)  Our neighbors don&apos;t stick to the safe and Sane either.  Jack and I went out for a quiet moment in the spa and were surrounded by a Fireworks show with out the music just laughing and glee from all the pyros.  Before I realized our dogs were terrified I really didn&apos;t mind so much, but watching Oso run around the house and freak out to each load boom, has made me really hate living here and I am now looking for a new state with Sane fireworks laws.
