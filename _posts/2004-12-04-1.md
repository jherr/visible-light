Our day in Eugene has been wonderful.  First we took Sadie to a dog park which was really big.  Sadie absolutely loved it.  It was lush and green and right on a small river.  Megan and I enjoyed meeting all the local dogs, and we ended up hanging out for about an hour.  On our way out of the park we discovered a community garden.  We headed out for a drive around, found the U of O campus, some wonderful home communities and were surprised by the number of community gardens in the different neighborhoods.  We stopped at a Target for a potty break, then headed to lunch at a cute dinner by the U of O campus.  We ended at Borders where we got a new book on tape for me and another Olivia book for Megan.  On our way back to hotel for some quiet time.  We&apos;ll head back out for dinner later.  We did find  a more industrial not so attractive side of town, but I&apos;m still very impressed with this lovely city.
