Megan cut her own hair.  I found a small clump the other day and when she was confronted with it she said yes she had but it was such a small clump I let it slide with the warning of don&apos;t do it again.  Today before Dance class I tried to french braid it and found much of the hair was too short to reach the back.  I asked her did she cut more hair and she said no she had not.  I gave up and did a pony tail with a bit of hairspray to help the sides.  But then... while cleaning up I found the pile of cut hair and I realized she really went at it.  I looked more closely and saw she&apos;d whacked her bangs and her sides.  So we headed off to the local children&apos;s hair place and got the nice lady there to even it all out.  


When I told Megan we&apos;d have to go get it cut I think she thought I meant cut it all off cause she broke into tears terrified.   I assured her the lady would just cut a little so she calmed down... ON the way she told me I&apos;m sorry Mommy...  I&apos;m not mad Megan you should tell your self sorry.  well she sobbed  a little more and then said I am sorry to myself and I forgive myself.  Good I said - why don&apos;t you give your self a hug - and she did.
