I really can&apos;t complain - i have nothing to complain about and yet today I have a general feeling of annoyance.  

It might be that the pool this morning was really crowded.  I managed my mile but it was a struggle with this really rude guy who has horrible lap pool etiquette.  

Maybe its that Ikea  now only allows kids 45 mins in the play area, and i had a list that meant I needed at least an hour in the store - which means I rushed, Collected Megan ran back to pay and found out i&apos;d picked up parts to 2 different chairs, so i didn&apos;t get the chair I wanted.  I got out to the car and realized the sheets were 20 dollar&apos;s more expensive than I had read the sign for.  So those will have to go back.   So while i did manage to find a organization thing for Megan&apos;s toys, I feel as though it was a wasted morning.  

We had a lovely lunch with friends and home for some Wii  and quite time. Now i&apos;m watching  [The Oh in Ohio](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10004665-oh_in_ohio/)  which is better than the critics gave it credit for but I&apos;m not positive I recommend it.

Ok i&apos;m feeling better now - but the morning was annoying.
