We had the elliptical trainer for one whole week before I got sick.  I used it as planned for that week, and haven&apos;t been able to since.  But i&apos;m feeling better, and coughing hardly at all, so today after Megan&apos;s nap I decided it was time to give it a try. 4 minutes later, I was coughing up a lung.  by the time I made it to the back bedroom I unfortunately had to throw up.  Before pregnancy I never had a cough that made me puke, but since - thanks I think to 9 months of throwing up, I can pretty much do it on command, so a big bad coughing fit is no biggy.  

So as I was hugging the toilet, Megan came in to find out what was wrong with mommy, only I was too busy to calm her fears.  She was a good doctor though and after I was through and changed she ushered me in to the living room where she promptly gave me a physical with her Doctors kit.

Guess I&apos;ll wait a couple more days and try again.
