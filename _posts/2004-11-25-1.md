After a tiring walk around Walla Walla and lots of playing with the boys, I took Megan up for some Bear and animals (dvd) and then a nap.  10 minutes after I put her down upstairs and shut the door, she appeared down stairs with her blanket, one of her Aunt Jen&apos;s baskets which had my moisturizing cream and her socks in it.  This meant that she not only climbed out of the pack and play but she also opened a door, did the stairs all by herself with her arms full.  I took her back up to our room and cuddled with her while she cried realizing that I was still intent on her napping, when she&apos;d calmed down I put her in the crib and went out the door.  before I made it around into the next room to peak through the french doors, she was out of her crib!

Tomorrow I will search for  [a Crib Tent](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/baby/B00014PLAY/qid=1101448295/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/102-4923500-4664142)  to use till we get home so that I can get her to nap!  Otherwise she is a very cranky Miss Megan come bed time.
