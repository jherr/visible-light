Jack and I just got back from a date night bike ride - we biked 20 miles total up alameda creek, over to mad fish sushi in Fremont and then back down the creek and then home.  I&apos;m exhausted in ways I can&apos;t believe- I think it is the single biggest exercise activity I&apos;ve done in my life.  And I can&apos;t wait to do it again - 

after the padded bike shorts arrive.<br />
