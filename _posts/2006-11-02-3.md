if it hadn&apos;t been such a mess...

Megan decided this morning while I was occupied to give Duncan a bath.  She pulled her stool up to the sink, LOCKED the door and proceeded to give him a bath with hand soap.  By the time I discovered them the floor was covered in water and Little guy was a ball of soap.  Megan was wet, her dolls were wet everything was wet.  It took me 3 towels just to mop up the water on floor and counter, I then had to rewash Duncan and dry him off.  

It was a bit more than I intended to do this morning.
