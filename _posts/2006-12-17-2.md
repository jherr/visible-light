Jack threw me an awesome party yesterday.  Most of my mom friends came, along with a couple of others.  We had lots of yummy food, a really cute home made cake, face painting for the kids, a tarot card reader, and best of all a really great masseur.  I got a 30 minute massage at the beginning of the party and then every one else got to disappear for 15 mins or so and get a mini massage.  She was really great.  I will definitely be going back to her again some time soon.  

The Wii was also a big hit, most of the kids gave it a try and 2 older kids went crazy making people for it and now we have lots of avatars.
