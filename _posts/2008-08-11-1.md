Mike, Missy and I took the kids down to  [Weeki Wachee](http://www.weekiwachee.com/)  today for some fun in the sun.  We arrived just after 11 so we had to wait till 3 to see the mermaid show.  But we did a boat ride and wondered around before enjoying the delights of Buccaneer Bay.  The water park is a natural spring with water at 74.2 degrees year round.  THe kids all loved the slides and jumping from the floating dock.  

Megan got turned on one of the slides and took it very personally when the life guard told her she shouldn&apos;t do that or they wouldn&apos;t let her slide anymore.  She then tried to do some different slides and was told she was too short (by less then 1/2 of an inch!)  She&apos;s basically right on the 48 inch line and sometimes she&apos;s measured above and others below.  By the time she&apos;d walked back down the steps she was in tears, but managed to dry them up and head back over to the slides she&apos;d been doing to go again.  

We ended the day with what Missy called &quot;Gouda, brie, mozzarella, and cheddar all rolled into one&quot; - the mermaid show that Weeki Wachee is famous for.
