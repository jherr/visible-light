we have lost not one, not two, but three different sets of keys.  Most notably is the damn truck key which with out we aren&apos;t able to take the stuff we&apos;ve unloaded onto friends to them. 

I&apos;m beginning to wonder if we have a dog who likes to bury keys!  But The truth is I&apos;m sure that they have just been misplaced.  ANd we will spend the next few days searching.
