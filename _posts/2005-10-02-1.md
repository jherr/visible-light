so Megan had a great day yesterday without a nap, playing with her friend Josephine first at her house and then at ours.  She slept in this morning till 9:30 and when she woke up Jack went into get her so she knew it was still the weekend.  After her 3 hour nap this afternoon, she woke up to me opening her door and jumped out of bed very excited.  We went to the potty and while she was sitting there she said... &quot;School today!&quot;  I said not sweetie its night time, we&apos;re making dinner and then bath read books and cuddle.  She gave me a very cute pout and said &quot;no Megan go school!&quot;  I said no &quot;but you can take OSO on a walk with Daddy&quot;  well the tears started rolling then and she said &quot;no Daddy go work, Megan go to school!&quot;  I said I was sorry and offered to cuddle and she finished on the potty and we headed to the sofa where she had me hold her while she pouted and teared for 20 mins.  

Man the girl loves school!  ... kind of wish I&apos;d signed her up for 3 days instead of 2.
