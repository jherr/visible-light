I majored in History in Collage, and so i&apos;ve always had a soft spot for historical movies.  I particularly love when they get me motivated to read more about it.  So tonight I refreshed on Henry&apos;s six wives (mostly about Anne Boleyn) after reading up on John Adam&apos;s and Thomas Jefferson&apos;s friendship.  I also was appalled to read about  [Nabby Adam&apos;s surgery for Breast cancer.](http://www.shsu.edu/~pin_www/T@S/2002/NabbyAdamsEssay.html)   That poor woman really suffered.  

Only a few years ago I would have had to make a point of going to the library to look something up that I saw on TV. Now thanks to the likes of wikipedia I have instant gratification.
