Last night I saw the movie &quot;The Queen&quot; with a mom friend and seeing QE2 being followed by a herd of Corgi&apos;s made me want to have a whole herd of Duncan&apos;s - it was just too cute.

I recommend the movie - it was odd to watch something about a time I vividly remember and yet had pushed from my memory.  When Diana died I was visiting Jacqueline in Tennessee who was moving out of her apartment where a brown recluse had bit her.   I had just found out my mom had cancer and had gone ahead with my trip to Tennessee since it had already been planned but it was a tough time to try and have fun.  

Jack and I had just moved back from Australia a member of the commonwealth and I had really begun to follow the Royal&apos;s and Diana in-particular while we were there.  Her death floored me.  I was amazed at the worlds turn out and yet I too felt a surprising amount of grief.
