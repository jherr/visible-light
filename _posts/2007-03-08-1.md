Megan woke up at 1 am screaming in pain last night.  After some Tylenol she settled down but woke up again in less than an hour, I calmed her down again and again she woke up screaming, At some point I just climbed into bed with her and she finally slept.  I snuck out at 6 and again she woke screaming.  She joined me for a bit and then went back to her room.  At 7 I got up and told her to get dressed and we headed to the doctor, who has drop in urgent morning appointments.  We actually got seen quicker than ever before.  

The Doctor found an ear full of puss and we headed to get antibiotics and pain drops.  At the store Megan with some motrin under belt slept in the shopping cart.  Once home she was feeling better and spent the day watching TV.  I spent the day trying to sleep but really never got to - my body just didn&apos;t want to.. by night I had a seal cough and my own ear pressure - same bug.  Megan is out like a light and am heading to bed shortly.

Our trip to Monteray tomorrow is called off - it&apos;ll just be another easy day at home for us.
