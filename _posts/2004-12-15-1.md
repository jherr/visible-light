Someone gave Megan a  [Potty Elmo ](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00020V50M/qid=1103149789/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl21/002-5939119-9969621?v=glance&s=toys&n=507846) for her birthday.  Basically its a mechanical doll that gulps as it drinks and then asks to goto the &quot;potty&quot;  It has some magnets in its butt and if its butt is on its potty than he successfully goes potty, and if his butt isn&apos;t on the potty then well &quot;accidents happen&quot;.  Megan delights in saying &quot;No&quot; when we tell her get elmo to the potty.  That darn monster has had an accident all in almost every room in our house.
