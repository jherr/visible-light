Megan slept in today till 11, so she when she got up, I made her breakfast and we played till about 12 when we headed to BabiesRUs for hopefully the last time, to buy potty training supplies (ie potty seat) and then we headed to  [music class ](http://www.musictogether.com/) which was alot of fun.  Then a quick trip to the grocery store before coming home and watching Ice Age (while I cleaned the back bedrooms).  We ended the day with a walk around the neighborhood at dusk.

Tonight after Megan went down I headed over to a friends house for 3 hours of scrapbooking and gossip.  I managed to scrapbook all of our trip to florida last summer - a total of 11 pages.
