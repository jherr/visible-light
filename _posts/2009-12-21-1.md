I had a really wonderful birthday yesterday.  Despite my hip!  Megan and I got Mani/pedi&apos;s and for dinner we went to the Brazilian steak house in San Mateo  [Espetus](http://www.espetus.com/) .  We had a lovely meal.  Megan tried everything and said it was such a fancy restaurant because there was no TV anywhere - ah  - that&apos;s my girl!

We came home and I opened my presants and Jack gave me a  [Kindle!  ](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reading-Display-Generation/dp/B0015T963C/ref=amb_link_86378071_2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_r=159KQ79RT959SS5T2QQE&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=506391311&pf_rd_i=507846)  

I&apos;m very excited to try it out.  Already I&apos;ve uploaded the book I&apos;m currently reading and since it weighs a small ton I&apos;m relieved to be reading it on such a light kindle.  I feel so futuristic.  I downloaded a book for Megan too and she was up early reading - very excited to use it.
