Here&apos;s some pics of our veggie garden.  Last year our garden was planted and then ignored thanks to my broken foot.  This year I thought with Jack&apos;s wrist we wouldn&apos;t even plant it - and then I got inspired a weekend or so ago and cleaned and planted the whole thing.  Then the yard man helped me figure out sprinklers (always a Jack job) - now its all a go.

The whole garden

Brand new strawberries.  I ripped out all the old and planted 4 new plants.  We hadn&apos;t had a decent crop of  strawberries in a couple of years.

Basil on the right and peppers on the left.

Tomatoes, 6 plants total 2 romas, 2 grape, an heirloom and an obscure variety someone at the nursery recommended.

There&apos;s one more bed - with Marjoram, Oregano (both from last year still going strong) and 2 new lemon cucumber plants.  I also plan another bed for behind the a/c i&apos;ve already got the dirt for it, we&apos;re going to grow pumpkins there.

Finally - my little helper
