Today after going to Apple, Megan and I ventured into the new East Palo Alto Ikea store.  Much bigger than the ones in Australia and not as crowded as the one North of Oakland.  I got a kick out of the snack bar.  Your choices are Hotdog, Cinnamon bun, vanilla frozen yogurt, and a 16 oz drink.  thats it no hamburgers, no chocolate, no 32 oz&apos;s here :)  One size fits all! or just order 2 if you want 32 oz.  It was a dollar for each item, so the bill was easy.  



I managed to find the one type of shoe rack for the closet, a strap for a high chair that I&apos;m going to use for shopping carts for Megan, and a new fitted sheet for our bed that was surprisingly soft for the 29.99.  If anyone from the bay area goes there, drive past the entrance parking spots that i&apos;m sure are full - go to the exit, that part of the lot was empty. - probably won&apos;t work on the weekend, though.
