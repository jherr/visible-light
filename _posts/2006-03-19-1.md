I was so looking forward to film club, an afternoon to immerse myself in something new and possibly exciting.  i&apos;ve been disappointed before - a documentary about women wrestlers comes to mind - but even then I was entertained.  

Today I actually fell asleep - i&apos;ve never fallen asleep in a theater before.  The movie was  [Frisbee](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465467/) the story of a hippie Pentecostal preacher from the 70 and 80s.  I was so bored I actually left before the film maker spoke to the the group after the film.  After missing a couple of film clubs, I&apos;m so annoyed that my first chance back was for one so boring, so tedious, so inane.  I&apos;ve never cared less for a subject and a film. 

Granted poor Frisbee got the shaft.  He helped start the  [Calvary chapel](http://www.calvarychapel.com) and vineyard churches down in the LA area only to be ostracized for being gay.  And you can imagine how righteous the church leaders felt when Frisbee died of aids in 1993.

The trouble for me was that I just didn&apos;t care about the films material, the people interviewed for the character that was Lonnie Frisbee.  Boring - enough said.
