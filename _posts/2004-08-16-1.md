Sadie isn&apos;t doing well.  She lost almost 15lbs  while i was gone, refusing to eat.  and though she is now eating, I took her to the vet today and they diagnosed her as being diabetic,  on top her Pancreatic Enzyme disease. So when Jack gets home, I&apos;m off to buy insulin and other stuff to keep her going.  She really seems OK but I don&apos;t want to loose her so soon after we lost Ripley.  That would just be too tough.
