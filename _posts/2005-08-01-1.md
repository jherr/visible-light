I can honestly say i&apos;m feeling better.  The left side of my throat doesn&apos;t hurt much at all, which give me hope that my right side will stop being excruciating soon.  Jack is getting me more pain meds and today is my final day languishing in bed.  Jack is back to work in the morning.  I still haven&apos;t managed to eat much.  But i&apos;m craving some scrambled eggs that Jack has promised me for later - nice and runny and easy to swallow.
