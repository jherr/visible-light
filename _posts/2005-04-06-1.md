After a month at grandpa&apos;s I started packing up today for our trip tomorrow to Houston.  We&apos;re going to head out early in the morning and hit the  [Florida Aquarium](http://www.flaquarium.org/)  in Tampa on our way to the airport.  Should be fun, though last time we went with Jack too.  So todays agenda is simple, pack up, get rental car, eat some of grandpa&apos;s freshly baked bread, watch Pooh Bear, take the dogs on one last walk up to the geese.  A couple of the geese mom&apos;s have had their babies so its a fun sight.  We also have one last dinner with dad and his gang of friends.  And I sorely need to give grandpa&apos;s car a once over with the shop vac.

Then there is the  [West Wing ](http://www.nbc.com/The_West_Wing/index.html)  season Finale!.
