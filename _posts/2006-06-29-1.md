So 2 nights ago I couldn&apos;t sleep, then last night I couldn&apos;t sleep, and for 2 days my gut has been tied in knots.  I knew something wasn&apos;t right but it was this morning when I entertained the idea of not getting the tattoo that I started feeling better.  I guess that if I had ever really wanted one I would have done it by now. 

Once I made the decision and called the place to cancel my appointment for today I almost immediately felt relief.  :) Dad while this makes you happy I want you to know I decided against it for myself - no swimming for 3 weeks was a bit much, the permanence of the tattoo (Though a friend did remind me that there is laser removal), any and all pain involved.  Its not to say I won&apos;t get one someday but right now I just don&apos;t really want one.
