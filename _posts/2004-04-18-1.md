My big brother David has set up a website for  [himself and his family](http://home.comcast.net/~dmjhcuth/index.html) .  It&apos;s a great beginning Dave - looking good.  (Might want to try and figure out how to shrink down the size of the pictures though so that people with dial- up don&apos;t suffer too much :)
