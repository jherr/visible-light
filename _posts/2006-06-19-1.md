Sadie&apos;s death distracted me from an otherwise big day.  Megan finished her first year of preschool, on thursday.  The school put on a really sweet program and Megan got a certificate.  After an after school party we headed to Chuck E Cheese with a school friend to celebrate.  Thankfully it was open (wink wink). 

She was still terrified of the person in the mouse suit, but had a ball running around the hamster (or is that mouse) trail, using the slide, and playing with all the games.  

Friday we headed out to playgroup and when we returned home Oso had shredded and I do mean shredded both screens.  So after  Megan went down for a nap I dug out Ripley&apos;s old crate from the shed and hosed it out.  But the years had not been kind - it was really gross and rusty, so on Saturday we bought a new one.  He actually seems to really like the crate and it saves us from having anything else destroyed.  

Friday evening i went out with my friend Kari to  [Tender to the Bone](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767903382/sr=8-1/qid=1150784692/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-9979277-4576802?%5Fencoding=UTF8)  which I loved.

Saturday we also took Oso to the dog park, and he got a bath.  We managed to spend a lovely afternoon at the pool.
