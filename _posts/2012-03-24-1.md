When I talk about my Atheism, I&apos;m told by some religious people that I&apos;m belittling their faith, because i guess faith and non believers can&apos;t live together in harmony.     In their minds they have the right to discuss and be who they are but I don&apos;t.   

The truth is though  I don&apos;t want to convert anyone to my way of thinking.  I just want to have the same right to celebrate my life and choices that they have.   I&apos;ve been talking about it more opening because I want acceptance.  Recently I&apos;ve found a circle of like minded friends, and now today there is a march on the mall in Washington.  Not to protest religion or push Atheism, but to seek acceptance and celebrate diversity.   [NPR has an excellent story I&apos;d like to share.](http://www.npr.org/2012/03/24/149285310/atheists-seek-acceptance-following-hearts-not-faith?sc=tw)    <br />
