Jack and I have been married 13 years today.  For those of you who wonder - its the Lace Aniversary! I am happier today that I was when I got married, and at the time I thought that was the best time of life.  Our life has only gotten better.  Sure we drive each other crazy, like when Jack put Megan&apos;s security blanket in the wash yesterday and didn&apos;t tell me or put it in the dryer and I had to deal with a very upset Megan for the 30 mins it took to dry yesterday, while he was at the movies, *&%$##&^ !  but really I count myself very lucky that  [ Jack ](http://www.muttmansion.com/ds) is my husband, and wants to spend the rest of his life with me.


I love you Jack- I&apos;m looking forward to spending many many more years.
