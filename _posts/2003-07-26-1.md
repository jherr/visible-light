Eddy&apos;s and dryer&apos;s, Carls&apos; Junior and Hardees, Breakstone and Knudson - why oh why do companies think they must rename things from one coast to the other?  At least Burger King&apos;s story in Australia made since.  Some guy went to America and saw that BK was McD&apos;s biggest compition.  Well McD was already down under but BK was not - so he went home and bought the rights to the name BK - so if you want a Whopper Down under you need to go one of  Hungrey Jacks, BK&apos;s largest franchised chain.

I don&apos;t see why California&apos;s wouldn&apos;t eat Eddy&apos;s, Hardee&apos;s or Breakstones or why the east coast would care if they had Dryer&apos;s ice cream, Carls Junior burgers or Knudson.  Do you understand it?  Let me know if you think of any other renamed chains or products.
