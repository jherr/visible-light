Jack came home from work, Megan was just up from her nap so we loaded up the stroller and walked to the polling place.  Megan has been eyeing my &quot;I voted&quot; sticker ever since.  I went ahead and voted for Dean since I really liked a lot of what he had to say.  I&apos;m hoping if he gets enough votes the democratic party will acknowledge his opinions on medical care etc.  Kerry will be on the ticket and that&apos;s fine, he&apos;s got my vote in the general election.  Most importantly we need to get rid of Bush and his notion of his own entitlement.
