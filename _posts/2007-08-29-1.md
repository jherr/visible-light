Megan started Kindergarten today.  She had a tough night, because of the excitement of it all.  And woke up this morning buzzing with anticipation!  We got over there with a few minutes to spare, and then we were greeted by a very warm teacher.  Megan beamed.  I got her settled and then headed out about my day.  My Target story is for another time.

I headed back to get her and I could just tell she had a good time.  When she got in the car she said guess what mommy ... I get to go back tomorrow!


... course tonight she asked me when the next summer is :)
