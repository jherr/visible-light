Friday was the anniversary of mom&apos;s death.  I realized last night it was why I was in such a rotten mood.  I miss her, but more I pissed that she is missing so much. Megan would have loved her so much and delighted in her grandma.  I can&apos;t believe how fresh and raw her death some times feels.
