I stumbled onto  [Amanda&apos;s blog](http://www.amanda.veryzen.com/)  this morning.  Her house was destroyed but she&apos;s safe and alive and relived to be so.   It made me feel more connected to read it and yet I don&apos;t know her at all.  But reading back a few dozen entries, makes anyone feel like a friend.
