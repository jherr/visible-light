I&apos;m a sucker for pretty much all holidays, and Valentines is no exception.  It started yesterday when Megan and I first made lollipops and then decorated valentines. I enjoyed hanging out today with Megan&apos;s school, and seeing all the kids decorate for valentines.  Then we picked up Jack and had lunch before heading over to the mall for alittle shopping.  Megan got her feet measured and though she&apos;s grown in inches (the kids is very tall) her feet are still the same size.  

We ended out Bounce Oh Rama, where Megan enjoyed bouncing while, I listened to my ipod and as I watched her.  I&apos;ve gotten into a couple of podcasts, and they certainly helped fill the boredom of hanging out and watching a kid bounce.  I have in the past joined her, but forgot socks today so my bouncing was out.

We got home and I exercised while Megan watched a movie.  Then we swapped gifts and Megan gave Daddy a card she made, Jack gave me a beautiful arrangement of plants, and I gave him some combat fatigue shorts (inside joke).  

What else made this valentines so special is that I&apos;ve been swapping valentines with  [ with my sistas](http://www.chubbygirlbrigade.com/2006/02/important_note_.html)  (oh and one bloke in Japan).  Its been a hoot getting valentines from all over the US,  Canada and Japan too!
