I finished Harry Potter&apos;s latest installment this evening.  I know Megan will be ecstatic when she realizes mommy&apos;s not reading anymore.  I&apos;m relieved to not be so hooked I&apos;m trying to figure out how to get my next fix.  And overall I have to say I don&apos;t think this installment of HP was as well delivered as the previous 5.  I could see scenes set up for the movie more than I could previous books, and this annoyed me.  Don&apos;t get me wrong it was a great book and I was entertained and I&apos;m looking forward to the next (supposedly last but I doubt it), but I think it was more thrown together, more ad-hoc.
