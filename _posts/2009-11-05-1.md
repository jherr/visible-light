I finished Megan&apos;s costume the day before the her parade at school.  It was a day of great pain for her as she took a spill during PE ï¿¼and scraped her face - her cheek, eye lid and fore head. So she spent the day lounging on the sofa with an ice pack on her eye while I finished the waste band and the shortened the belt.

If I do say so myself her costume rocked.  I totally blew my own socks off.

Note - On her face - it took exactly less than a week for her scabs to heal and fall off and her face too looked almost perfect - just a slight pinkish where the scabs had been.  Her knees however, still are scabbed up - go figure.
