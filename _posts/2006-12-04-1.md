Here is the Apron I made for the apron exchange.  Mine was the only home made one.

Modeled by the winner of it who is 7 months pregnant!

It was really lovely party.  I had a massage, then I had way too much champagne some yummy food and then a pedicure, followed by more food drink and the apron exchange.  I had lots of great conversations with interesting and beautiful women.
