I&apos;ve been dreaming lately that I&apos;ve lost fingers.  I wasn&apos;t even troubled by the dreams which is troubling.  It would just be a totally normal dream about me flying or cooking, and i&apos;d notice I&apos;d lost another finger.  Last nights dream I only had 7.  I&apos;m not sure what the significance of missing digits is... or at least I didn&apos;t until I started grinding coffee beans this morning and the grinder wouldn&apos;t turn off.  Its been stuck on alot lately and I&apos;ve been unplugging it to get the coffee out. I think we need a new grinder - perhaps my next trip to COSTCO.
