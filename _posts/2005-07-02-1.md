I went to Barbara&apos;s hen night last night.  And I had wonderful time.  Part one was hanging out with family at a  [lovely B&B in Hollywood](http://www.secretgardenbnb.com/) .  We had a wonderful dinner, and Barbara opened up a few gifts (mine being the only &quot;adult humor&quot; one - alittle embarrassing but it was a &quot;bachlorette&quot; party!  Then Some of the group headed off the a club where the party and gossiping continued.  I enjoyed getting to know Barbara&apos;s friends and family.  And I had taken a cab in Hollywood, so I took advantage of the night out and drank more than I had in years.  It was a wonderful night.
