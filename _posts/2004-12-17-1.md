Megan and I went to the zoo today with her friend William, his mom and his new baby sister.  We had a lovely morning walking around the the animals. We were all a bit grossed out watching one elephant pull poop out of another ones butt and eat it though.  According to zookeeper that was there, its a dominance thing among the females. 

We had a lovely lunch at the zoo cafe, before walking around the rest of the zoo.  I took Megan and William into pet the goats and sheep.  Then we headed back out to the  rides area, and enjoyed the merry go round and the train.  

Megan is now napping.
