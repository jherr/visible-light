I broke down and snuck out of the room not once but twice while Megan slept.  We snuck out so Sadie could pee and then again so she could finish the job.  Now&apos;s she&apos;s been fed and happy.  And Megan who I&apos;m sure was traumatized by the abandonment and will need a therapist at 30 slept through the whole thing.
