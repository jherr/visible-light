Megan&apos;s b-day party yesterday was wonderful - it really went off well.  The bounce house arrived early, Pizza&apos;s were done when Jack went early to pick them up so he was back in time for the party to start.  The kids loved making crowns - which was the art project, and the food that I did make was gobbled up (Salad, Hummus, Fruit tray and veggies).

Jack&apos;s cake was spectacular.  The pink Castle was a fulfillment of Megan&apos;s dreams and the princesses sat very regally on top.  

The cute moment of the day was when a very cute very small puppy walked right up the red carpet (ie table cloth I ran down the front walk) and into the party.  We popped him in a bathroom till after the party but after he really worked hard at getting us to fall in love.  No sign of an anxious owner but we aren&apos;t claiming him yet - i&apos;ll report him to the shelter on Tuesday when the open, and we&apos;ll put some signs up - till then he&apos;s an uninvited but very welcome guest.
