I headed down to LA saturday afternoon, in order to goto my dear friend Barbara&apos;s baby shower!.  I flew down mid morning, rented a car and drove slowly over to the movie theater/bar the shower was at because I was 3 hours early.  It was a happy hour Baby shower.  I really had a great time.  I&apos;m so glad I got to see Barbara before the baby comes next month.  She is so radiant and beautiful.  Pregnancy suits her, but I&apos;m sure that she&apos;ll be a more radiant mother.

sorry the photo&apos;s not better quality - I used my phone.

Anyway the shower was a hoot.  I did have a few hiccups coming home.  At the parking garage when I tried to prepay for my parking the machine ate my credit card, and I had to wait 15 mins for a guy to come get it out.   Then when I returned to the airport I realized I was getting 44 miles to the gallon in the hybrid I rented and i&apos;d driven like 22 so I didn&apos;t bother filling up - it was still on full, I got a huge lecture from the check in guy at the rental agency.  He did give me a credit back on the non refill fee but  he did make me feel like a child.
