My mood matches the weather, cold, bitter and grey.  I will always feel this election like the last was stolen.  I will never trust voting machines that don&apos;t leave a paper trail. I have faith that history will bear witness to the truth and we will one day know how evil this whole mess was.

I am sicken and disgusted that good people couldn&apos;t see through the lies of the crook in office and saw fit to give him 4 more years to destroy our reputation in the world, neglect the poor, destroy the environment, give blank checks to the likes of Haliburtin, get our young service men killed... on and on...  I fear for this nation.  

If Kerry had won I would have hoped that conservatives would have given him a chance before attacking... but I can&apos;t do the same because we&apos;ve had 4 years of this imbecile and this nation is going to be in  bad shape to have suffer through 4 more years.  

This man you all just reelected... took a lack of popular vote and made it a mandate for the last 4 years... I shudder to think what he is going to do now.
