Ah kids, they get the best germs!  Megan and I are suffering from  [Hand Food and Mouth Disease](http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/hfmd.htm) .  Megan is irritable and has the rash.  Overall she seems to feel ok but is quick to be cranky.  I can&apos;t swallow and feel so drained.  Tomorrow is going to be Nemo for sure.
