We&apos;ve had a wonderful morning.  Megan saw her kitchen and instantly fell in love - spending the next hour preparing us pizza and shrimp and OJ and toast.  Jack took lots of video and pictures so I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll have them all up later.  We opened up our gifts while our yearly cinnamon buns were baking and smelling delicious.  After a few phone calls with family, Jack and Megan took Russell (who jumped the fence twice this morning) on a hike, while i started dinner.   Pam, Yvonne, and Josephine are going to join us.  So far I&apos;ve made dough for rolls and I&apos;m roasting some garlic and tomatoes for  [Tomato and Herb Tart](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/109675)  which I plan to serve with Salad and fresh grilled veggies.  I&apos;m going to make a mini pizza for Megan and Josephine.  I&apos;m off to start the salad, and continue cleaning up our booty while Megan isn&apos;t here to protest.
