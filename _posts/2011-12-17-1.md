When we bought this house, we thought the garage had some nice built in cabinets, but when we moved in we realized they weren&apos;t nice, but cheap, [ 6 inch deep boxes with a handle drawer ](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90181124/#/30110832) that popped it out and allowed you to put stuff in.  Turns out they were shoe racks.

Anywho - we didn&apos;t like them, they were filthy and really impractical.  But we left them, too busy to consider what to do with them.  

About 2 weeks ago I said to Jack - why don&apos;t we just take them out?  They eat up about a half of foot of depth in our garage and we are never going to use them  And so - he did.

That should have been the end of it.  But alas it was not...

A few days later I noticed water on the floor of the garage.  Oh - my car A/C must be having issues I thought.  A few days more and still more water.  

Then one night I had Megan take a shower and the next morning Lee our Nephew who is living with us now took a shower, while I was out.  When I came home - there was so much more water on the floor of the garage than before - can&apos;t be my a/c unit.   After a little investigation I found where it was coming from - the back wall behind and old dresser which now sat where these cabinets used to be. Cut to last night - Jack and a neighbor friend pull down the dry wall around that point and we see the drain pipe running through the wall -they had used it as a stud and now with the cheapo plastic boxes removed, we had 6 holes.  It leaked a little when someone flushed, or used the sink, but the shower is what sent water on to the floor of the garage.

Jack spent this morning removing the plywood ever so carefully since at any point there might be a branch off - He cut the blade down on his saw so that it couldn&apos;t cut too deep.  Then he exposed the pipe and the plumber who has been helping us since our old house, came out and looked and suggested an easy fix.  Screw screws back in and put silicon seal around it.  Not long screws but short copper ones.   so far so good.  If we were to replace the whole pipe we would have to jack hammer the concrete up at the base and tear out more of the wall.  Not pleasant prospects.  

and so we wait - for the sealant to dry and for the a week of showers and toilet flushing, and sink use oh and the washing machine - did I mention the washing machine comes to this pipe about 3 feet up from the ground.  

Here are some pics of the holes...
