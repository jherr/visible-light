Before the party on saturday, while I was running round to various stores to get supplies, I picked up a little &quot;Bar Cutting board&quot; basically its a cutting board that is around 6 inches by 4 and  dishwasher safe.  We have 2 big wooden boards in our kitchen and a pile of large cutting boards.  I have one that fits across the sink, another one for just meat.  But this little bullet sized one could go anywhere and made it so easy to prepare a ton of food in one small kitchen, because I didn&apos;t need a whole lot of room.  

My last best  find,  was my spice rack.  I needed a spice rack to hold more than just 12 little bottles.  Jack and I had tons of spices. I tried plastic containers that are really drawers with sticky labels on top to try and keep it all straight but I still ended up searching for spices I knew we had but just couldn&apos;t find. I found in a magazine the idea of use  [an Over the door shoe rack](http://stacksandstacks.com/html/20333_organizer-over-the-door-pocket-organizer.htm)  on our pantry door.  The one I found was clear plastic pockets so not only does it hold all our spices but you can easily see what is in each pocket.  It is really the best idea since sliced bread!
