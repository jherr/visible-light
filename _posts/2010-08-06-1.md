Megan and I are in LA for the weekend.  She doesn&apos;t know it yet but tomorrow we are going to a garage sale from the TV show &quot;Clean House&quot; (a show she loves!)  ...  after we will explore La Brea Tar Pits before heading down to Torrance for dinner with Aunt M.  

Sunday we are going to see my friend Barbara and her family including her new beautiful baby girl!  Finally Monday - and again the Megan has no idea - we are having lunch at ... wait for it ... the American Girl Cafe - don&apos;t you just wish you could join us! - Megan is going to be so excited when we walk in to a whole store (Building) dedicated to her American Girl Doll! - I only wish she&apos;d brought the doll shoes - as the doll has a seat at the table with us and they may not serve her without shoes! - She&apos;s at least wearing a shirt.

For your viewing enjoyment - a few pictures I found on the camera.
