I&apos;ve been cleaning and painting an old mirror frame I bought at a garage sale. After the first coat of paint it looked great. but I had missed a few spots so after 2 days I went back and spray painted those spots - and each and every one of those spots crackled. I&apos;ve now sanded those down and painted again and I seem to be making it worse - and now I&apos;ve run out of paint - any ideas? Or should I just sand down the whole thing and start again?

Its not very good quality so I can&apos;t really sand it down to much.
