And yet I&apos;m not sure what to blog about.  Megan is doing wonderfully.  I finally got some much needed work done on my car while Jack and Megan went hiking.

I saw School of Rock yesterday and spent the movie wondering why it got such good reviews.  It was an average flick - perfect for movie rental night.

Tomorrow we&apos;re going to a greek festival.  Should be fun.
