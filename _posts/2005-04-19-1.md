Oso comes in this morning after some very active squirrel chasing.  I say to him &quot;did you get the squirrel?&quot; He bolts for the door and is gone another 10 mins.  He comes back in tired and in need of a few zzz&apos;s and I say &quot;did you get the squirrel?&quot; He again bolts for the door and is gone.  Back and forth we went for at least 2 hours of my entertainment.  I finally made him come in so the poor Squirrel can come out of the tree and Oso will have something to actually chase.
