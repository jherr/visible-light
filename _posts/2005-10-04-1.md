yesterday I woke up to find that our fridge was not cold but cool and a puddle of water on the floor of it.  So Megan and I spent the morning looking at fridge replacements, picked one out, and bought it.  They said it would be delivered today and that I would be called around 11 about what time.  

Well they called at 6:50 this morning!,  I jumped out of bed and cleaned out the fridge, while, then Jack moved it out so I could clean behind it.  They were here by 7:20, and it was all done by 8.  Jack leaves and I start putting food away, only today is school.  I looked at the clock and realized it was 8:36...Megan is due at School at 9... so I ran in and got her out of bed, on the potty, dressed, me dressed, got her OJ and graham crackers (breakfast of champs!) in the car and booked it.  I put her shoes on her at school while she finished her OJ.  but we made it and only a couple of minutes late.  Then I came home and got a shower and clean clothes ... now the day can start.
