When I gave up being a vegetarian, I swore I would only eat chicken.  Then last thanksgiving I added Turkey.  a little over a month ago I took a cooking class and they cooked and served pork and lamb. both were delicious.  recently i&apos;ve added in beef. In South Carolina I had ribs for the first time, then last night I grilled a steak for the first time in 14 years.  It was incredible.  I put the left overs in the fridge and then spent the night dreaming about them.  Can you guess what I had for breakfast?

The funny thing is the last few times I tried to donate blood I was turned away for being slightly anemic.  Since I started with the beef, i&apos;ve felt my energy level rise.  I&apos;m guessing I was lacking the iron.  I due to donate blood in a week, i&apos;ll report back if they turn me away.
