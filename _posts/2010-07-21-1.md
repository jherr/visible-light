We headed out on hike today in  [Garin Park](http://www.ebparks.org/parks/garin) .   Our plan was to hike to and find Newt Pond. However once crossing the creek (or pond) we climbed up a bit thinking the path would come back around to the actual pond - instead we climbed up to the top of a big hill.  The choices were a 2 mile hike around the back side, back the way we came (very steep and full of brambles)  or down the front of the hill into the park proper - which turned out very steep.  We opted for 3.  The climb up had taken a bit of energy and it seemed the quickest way down.  Needless to say - I&apos;m proud of us all...  and I&apos;m feeling it tonight.
