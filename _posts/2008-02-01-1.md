Oso has many many quirks.  He&apos;s terrified of Jack cheering for a team on tv, he hates when we play video games, and he has to be tranquilized to  get his nails trimmed.  He is a very sweet boy over all and so we live with his many many idiosyncrasies.  

The one we&apos;ve know about but always ignored is when ever Jack and I get amorous - and I mean just look at each other in that way - the dog goes outside and stands waiting, staring at the sliding doors, pathetic... for however long because he can&apos;t bear to be under the roof when anyone is getting it on...

The second its over and I mean the second - he comes running in and jumps on the bed ready to sleep in his usual spot.  

So lately we&apos;ve had rain storm after rain storm.  And one such night he came back to bed soaked to the bone! He&apos;d rather stand in the rain than go to another room.  This from a dog who will hold his pee in for days so as to not get wet - thus I&apos;ve taken to tricking him as describe in my Jan 4th blog entry.
