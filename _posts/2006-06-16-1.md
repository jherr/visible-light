no clicking of paws, no demanding of breakfast at 5.  It is so incredibly quiet today.  Megan and I spent some time today looking at  [Sadie&apos;s page](http://www.muttmansion.com/wiki.cgi?SadiePage) .  She said she&apos;s sad too, I think she is kind of beginning to understand.  Sadie isn&apos;t ever coming back home.

I&apos;m so tired.  After bawling for a couple of hours last night my sinuses were full and my head hurt.  So when I tried to sleep I was just so restless.  And not hearing her paws clicking on the floors as she made her rounds. Did I ever blog that?  Sadie spent the nights making rounds.  Even after she went blind she would go from the back yard to the front window, stopping along the way to check us out.  She would push on Megan&apos;s door, I think a little annoyed she couldn&apos;t go in and check for her self.  She was our protector as we slept.
