At a holiday party yesterday, I had a long conversation with a woman about how she exercises her dog while she rides her bike.  This is not a new idea, but for the first time we have had a dog that it might work with.  Ripley was too big - 80 lbs of muscle and you go her way.  Oso too skittish,  Little Guy too lazy - half way down the block and he wants to be carried.  But Mimi - she is a bundle of energy and rarely do we do enough to burn that energy.  

So this morning after sneaking her and her leash past the boys, I got on my bike.  At first I walked while she walked along side, but very quickly I was able to start peddling.  We turned to a  quiet street and she started pulling on the leach wanting to run ahead - so I peddled faster - pretty soon we went around the block, and then we headed out again and went around the bigger block.  She started dragging by the end and so we headed back home.  

She only darted in front of me once - too much slack in the leash when we were turning - but over all a smashing success.  My hope is to start taking her to school with Megan in the morning and then run her all the way home.   <br />
