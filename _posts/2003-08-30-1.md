so Jack and I are trying to improve his asthma and allergy symptoms because they are the worst ever in recorded history (except Japan, I think they were worse then)  Anyway tonight I bought a new cotton filled comforter and we packaged up our down duvet and my down pillows.  Down was always so luxerious to me and I&apos;m going to really miss sleeping on air.  I&apos;ll adjust as I did  Sleeping for 2 weeks on the squeeky Lincoln Rope bed in Florida, and If Jack feels better than its totally worth it.
