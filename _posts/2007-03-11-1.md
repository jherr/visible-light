I&apos;ve been really sick all weekend.  Friday and Saturday I barely moved from bed, today I got up because Jack had wanted to work out so I feed the dogs and the girl, and took a shower, stripped out bed since i&apos;ve spent 2 days and nights sweating in it.  Then I spent the day in front of the tv in the living room, making small trips around the house to do odd chores.  Each one left me incredibly winded.  Just unloading the dryer and i had to spend a few minutes catching my breath.  This is the weirdest cold i&apos;ve ever had.  It just zaps my energy and makes taking deep breaths so impossible.

I&apos;m going to forgo swimming tomorrow which means there is no way i&apos;ll finish the swim the second time in the time left but I don&apos;t care.  If my breathing is as hard then i&apos;ll go to the doctor after I drop Megan at school, if not then I&apos;ll go get a pedicure and just have another day of healing.  Overall I feel like crap, I&apos;ve never really struggled for breath - it makes me appreciate what Jack goes through just by being around a cat.
