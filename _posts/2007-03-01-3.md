Despite cold medicine purported to knock you out I can&apos;t sleep so...

I&apos;ll tell you about our fabulous dinner tonight.  

I made pork chops with a curry rub - basically the rub consisted of Curry powder, cumin, brown sugar, chili powder and pepper.  I then grilled them to perfection.

On the side I served Basmati Rice that I cooked with Turmeric, cinnamon, Onions, Garlic, Butter, Raisins and cashews.  

and a side of Peas (which Megan ate with her Pasta and tomato sauce)
