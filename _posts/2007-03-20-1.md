I did finally go to the doctor last thursday.  She gave me an inhaler, cough drug and antibiotics.  I am feeling better, but I still am coughing a lot.  So much that last night I had to stop eating dinner.  I made chili that was way to spicy for me and wow I couldn&apos;t stop coughing.

I&apos;ve been back in the pool for the last 2 days - yesterday I swam for 40 mins, very few actual swimming, mostly just kicking with the kick board.  Today I was able to do a little more swimming including 8 lengths of pulling to give my arms a work out, but after 2 puffs of the inhaler I&apos;m still feeling like my breath is hard to catch- so maybe i over did it.  Tomorrow i&apos;ll probably go back to mostly kicking, and maybe by next week i&apos;ll be able to go back to swimming in miles.
