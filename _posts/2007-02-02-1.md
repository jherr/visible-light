Megan is sick, Fever, Cough stuffy nose.  Its all there.  She stayed at home today while Jack worked from home so I could go pick up our new over the stove exhaust fan, swim my mile, and return some stuff to Target.  

Our weekend was supposed to be entertain friends tonight, go out with sitter coming tomorrow, and then entertain a group on sunday for the superbowl.  We&apos;ve basically canceled all the entertaining and told the sitter if she didn&apos;t want to come over we understood, but she&apos;s decided she still will come, so we&apos;ll still be able to go out, if Megan is feeling up to it.

We enjoyed a few movies with Megan - We watched Spirited Away today and then Megan watched Alice in wonderland for the first time.
