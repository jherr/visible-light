Yesterday while cleaning up the yard, my foot went into one of Ripley&apos;s holes (she loved to dig) it went one way and I fell forward on my knee, slid a few feet and went head first into shed.  It took me about 10 mins to get Jack&apos;s attention.  Every time I asked Megan to get Daddy she&apos;d get a ball and throw it at me.  Jack finally heard me and came out - He saw the mess and rushed over - then he went straight to the shed and banged the door back into shape so it could close. 

My head went into  the shed and now I am all red.  I must stay in bed until my head is no longer red and i feel less dead.  Dr Suess got alot of play last night

I feel better - just my knee is really hurting.  My head is still sore though.
