One thing that did happen was we had 2 star sightings while at the Washington Dullas airport.  The first was after our first flight was canceled and we were wandering around the terminal.  We bumped into  [Andrew Firestone](http://www.andrewfirestone.com/meet_andrew.html)  of the bachelor fame, and he is very attractive in person.

Then on our flight out we had the pleasure of sitting 2 rows in front of  [Al Franken](http://www.andrewfirestone.com/meet_andrew.html)  and his radio crew who were on their way to Asheville to do the show live from University of North Carolina.  Jack managed a &quot;hello Al&quot;, and I enjoyed the team discussing the content of the next days show through out the flight.
