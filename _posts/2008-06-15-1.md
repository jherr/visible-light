Our summer has started with a busy weekend.  Its included a birthday party at Pump it up, her last gym class at  [No We Can&apos;t](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI7WwY4a9ro)  a spoof on the first.

Here&apos;s a pic I took of Megan at the party - in a big blow up throne ... my little princess.<br />
