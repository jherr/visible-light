as he cuddles with me tonight as I type this, asleep in my lap, I&apos;m amazed we found this incredible dog.  Megan today put the christmas jingle bell collar on him, she also tortures him by putting his toys in her bed or up on furniture that he won&apos;t jump up to get.  He is such a good patient dog.  He rolls over and gets belly scratches from her, and I think really loves her.
