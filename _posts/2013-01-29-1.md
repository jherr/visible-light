Last year we started walking the dogs every evening after dinner.  Now they expect it.  But I&apos;ve been feeling better and Then as Oso started declining, I took to giving him regular walks.  Slow and deliberate - they really cheered him up.  After he died, I took to taking out the little dogs one at a time in the morning.  Last week, I managed a mile with each dog in the morning and just like that I was doing 2 miles plus of walks a day.

Then yesterday I did my 2 miles, and then Megan wanted to goto park and use her new long board and just like that I&apos;d done a 5K.  

So today I just did it - 2 miles with the dogs and an extra in the afternoon before pickup.  Still short of the 5k by a bit, but If I had time, I could do that.

Getting the dogs used to walking in the morning means I can&apos;t back out.  But when it warms up and I start biking 4 miles round trip to Megan&apos;s school, 2 mile walks might be too much.

And just like that I&apos;m doing 2 miles to 5K a day.   <br />
