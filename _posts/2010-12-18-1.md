I haven&apos;t had time to run Mimi in 3 days.  yesterday I came home from picking up Mimi to find her on the sofa back paw in the air and urine all around her.  She was in obvious pain and couldn&apos;t put any weight on her leg.  I rushed her to the vet.  She has  [patellar luxation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxating_patella) , which had completely popped out.  The vet popped it back in, took XRays and gave her a shot for the pain.  She is to be kept from being too active and we have medication.  I&apos;m also supposed to Ice it and then heat it.  Icing means I hold her against me with an ice pack  between me and her.  Heating won&apos;t be hard - the dog finds the heating pad every time its turned on.  

The trouble was we were supposed to leave this morning for 6 days in Oregon with Jack&apos;s sisters family.  I didn&apos;t want to leave Mimi with the dog sitter so I stayed home.  Home for a week alone was not what I wanted for my birthday.<br />
