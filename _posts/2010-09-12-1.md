Megan is officailly a third grader.  She is loving school.  We had a fabulous summer which ended with labor day weekend  trip to Disneyland so that Jack could do the fabulous 5K and Megan and her friend Josephine ran in the kids race of 400m.  We had a really easy time until labor day - walking onto most rides.

One of the very cool and very fun things we did while there was a guided tour through the park.  It was called &quot;Discover the Magic&quot; tour and it was a treasure hunt through Disneyland park which ended with a private meeting with Mickey himself.  

Our final &quot;summer&quot; Trip will be camping this weekend - if I remember to tell the dog sitter.<br />
