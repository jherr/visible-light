All parents have gone through it - Megan started throwing up last night at 11, and continued every 30 mins till 2, she took an hour off and then did it one last time at 3:30.  We&apos;re all tired out.  Megan is really cranky but feeling better I think 

I took a nyqil last night since I got a cold for my birthday on wed.  I took it to get a good night sleep - but when the screaming and barfing started I managed to wake up and do what needed to be done - namely change sheets and clean & comfort child.  I think it safe to say we&apos;ll be spending the day at home.
