I&apos;ve mentioned Pinterest before but now I&apos;m going to prove how good this site is.  

some of my pinterest inspired successes....

First off valentines.. ![](/visible-light/images/assets/valentine-thumb-600x600-222.jpg)   Megan&apos;s valentines for the girls in her class were chopped crayons melted into hear shapes.  We used a very cheap (95 cent) silicone ice cube tray and a very very low oven.   They were a hit and you can use them to draw with - what ever color is at the point in the crayon is what color you draw with - the colors didn&apos;t mix into brown - they were just chunks of unique colors.

Second ...

This is just a flowing plant out of a sideways planter - I saw it on Pinterest and having bits of an old fountain we dismantled when we moved in - I&apos;ve already planted an ivy in one of the urns that has a spout, but this was simple and sweet and my hope is that it will grow into a beautiful touch in the garden. 

Third...

Today&apos;s project with Megan ...

Sharpie tie dye - using sharpies and rubbing alcohol.  

other things that don&apos;t photograph well is a soap scum buster - equal parts blue dawn dish washing soap and white vinegar - spray bottle - shake and spray - leave for 20 mins and then rinse away - a few areas needed a little scrubbing but nothing like using soft scrub- which is what I have used in the past and to top it off - the bath smells like a salad and isn&apos;t toxic.

oh and there was one about washing with soap and water the lint screen from your dryer to remove the buildup of fabric softener and stuff - wow - helps keep fires from happening and the clothes are drying better now to boot.

There has also been great food inspiration but I&apos;ll blog those later.
