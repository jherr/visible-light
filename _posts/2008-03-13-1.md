Did anyone else happen to catch Law and Order last night?

 [The Practice](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118437/) .  In just a few short years and way to much surgery she&apos;s gone from fairly beautiful albeit way to skinny 

To just plain puffy and weird.

I&apos;m searching for a current pic - but if you want to see -  [NBC puts a 2 minute replay of the episode online](http://www.nbc.com/Law_&_Order/video/index.shtml#mea=228464) Watch &quot;submission&quot; to get a glimpse of how she&apos;s become frankensteined.   Ladies - stay away from the knife - its makes you look so unnatural!
