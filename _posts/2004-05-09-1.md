We&apos;ve joined the  [ Treeview Swim Club ](http://www.clubswim.com/swimming-pools-detail.asp?poolid=1983) .  What this means is that Megan gets alot of time getting her feet wet.  Today though I enjoyed a break while Megan was napping, I snuck off and went by myself.  I really enjoyed time to swim some laps and sit in the sun and read National Geographic.  I&apos;ll planning on giving up a movie on the weekends and start enjoying the pool more often.  I inquired today about a class for Megan to take this summer.  If I can ever get Jack to come with me I&apos;m sure pictures will be put up on the site.
