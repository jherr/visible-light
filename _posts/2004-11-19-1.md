I cuddled with Maddie the Bolduc&apos;s dog last night and she got up at 5.  Megan started talking loudly while I was in the bathroom, so I hid downstairs with my laptop and coffee.  I don&apos;t like to let her get up before 7.  She usually settles back down and falls asleep if I just leave her be.  She wasn&apos;t crying, just talking.  Going through all her words and having fun in the process.  She&apos;s already starting to settle, but I&apos;m sure she&apos;ll be talking again once Sadie wakes up and heads down for breakfast.
