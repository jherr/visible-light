I decided to do Greek food for poker last night - I made Grilled Leg of Lamb (that had marinated in yogurt Lemon juice and rosemary for 3 days), Tabbouleh, Hummus, tzatziki, which I paired with some flat bread, olives, feta, mixed greens, etc.  Turned out it was the perfect night for it too as we had a scorcher yesterday and a cool dinner (i&apos;d grilled the lamb earlier in the afternoon) made it all the better.  

For dessert we had Roasted fruit (peaches, raspberries and blueberries) over ice cream.

The lamb was perfection - the marinated made it so tender and it just melted and the flavors were wonderful.  I omitted the parsley in the Tabbouleh and it was the first time i&apos;ve ever liked that dish.  Jack made the tzatziki for me since while i&apos;d bought all the ingredients I forgot all about it, and the hummus was my best ever!  For once i&apos;m glad we have some leftovers in the fridge.
