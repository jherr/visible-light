Tomorrow, i&apos;ve been called on to help out in Megan&apos;s class, because one of the teachers has to goto a funeral.  I&apos;m looking forward to it, but I will miss my 3 hours to myself.  Megan said that my going to school with her tomorrow was a &quot;good idea&quot;.

It should be an easy morning since its also the valentines party and other mom&apos;s will be arriving early to help set up for that.
