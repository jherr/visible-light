I haven&apos;t talked much about movie club lately... a few of the films I loved like  [Last Days](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0403217/)  which I loathed. So much so I thought of quitting the club and never returning.  I stuck it out... and this month the film was worth it.

 [The Talent Given Us](http://www.thetalentgivenus.com/)  is a wonderful film, fiction in story yet reality of cast.  The filmmaker Andrew Wagner filmed his family acting out a story, as themselves and yet not.  It was a hoot that on occasion hit to close to home, and other times was completely far fetched.  I really enjoyed it and figured I better recommend it since the film maker is actually going around trying to drum up viewers by word of mouth.  Because of that it probably won&apos;t play in a theater near you... so keep an eye out and rent it.
