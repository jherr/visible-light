5 years ago today my mother died.  Sometimes I still miss her so much I hold my breath, and tear up.  This usually happens when I rocking Megan to sleep and I realize she&apos;ll never know my mother.  Mom was a great Grandma to Sam and Kelly, my sister&apos;s daughters.  But the rest of us didn&apos;t get our act together and start reproducing until after she died.  She would have loved the baby boom.  Since her death we&apos;ve gone from 2 to 11.   

Sometimes when I want to feel close to her I&apos;ll go in to my closet and smell her perfume. My sister Robin gave me a bottle of it a few years back.  Shalimar was mom&apos;s scent.  She wore it so much that it always lingered on her and in her bedroom. Other times I settle for a trip to the closest Hallmark Store.  They all feel like her.  She would have loved some of the ornaments this year.   

I miss you mom.   I grieve that Megan won&apos;t know her grandma. I miss your hugs, our talks, and your laugh.  Today is just my day to feel Melancholy.
