so A little hope on the dog front.  We were contacted this evening by a woman with a rescue group that has turned us onto 2 dogs that sound great. We should meet them over the weekend and then who knows we may have a new member of our family to announce.

Meme as she calls herself is so adorable right now.  She has great words for everything like &quot;wahwe&quot; for water and  &quot;Sheba&quot; for Pizza. Tonight she put on her jacket, new white tennis shoes, sunglasses and &quot;helped&quot; Jack and I put a desk together. (meaning she stuck her screw driver in a few holes and walked all over the underside.  The Desk is a story all its on I&apos;ll save for when we get the room figured out.  

Today we went back to Little Gym and Megan once again refused to do all structured activities.  She did enjoy hanging from the bar, doing forward rolls and walking the balance beam.  We had Stefan and his mom over for &quot;ah sta&quot; and the two of them played very well together.  

We are trying out a music class on thursday night and next wed we start up Art again.
