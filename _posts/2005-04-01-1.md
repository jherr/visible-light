I took Megan today to  [Uncle Donald&apos;s Farm](http://www.florida-secrets.com/Uniquesites/WCsites/WCSpotlights/UncleDonaldsFarm.htm)  down in Lady Lake.  Its a really well organized entertainment farm, considering we were with 3 school buses full of kids. We had a hay ride, fed cows, fed, chickens, a baby goat,  and got to pet rabbits, pigs and chickens.  It was really alot of fun.  Megan refused the pony ride but we pet the pony and she liked that.  They also have lots of wild animals that are being rehabilitated.
