Watched the pilot for  [Patricia Arquette](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000099/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxzZz0xfGxtPTIwMHx0dD1vbnxwbj0wfHE9cGF0cmljaWEgYXJxdWV0dGV8aHRtbD0xfG5tPW9u;fc=1;ft=2)  working.  I&apos;ve loved her every time I&apos;ve seen her in something.

Anyway - I hope it last long enough to really get into it.  I liked that Oliver Platt Judge show that died in a few shows a couple of years ago and the Sally Field Supreme Court drama, oh and Josh Brolin show the freshman senator from California show - all show&apos;s I enjoyed that just disappeared.  And yet CSI Miami lives... I just don&apos;t get it.
