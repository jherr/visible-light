Jack and I saw the Da Vinci Code tonight and I did like it.  But it didn&apos;t blow me away the way the book did.  At times I was even bored - and that is because I liked the book so much.  I devoured that book, even spending weeks deciphering the codes on the book jacket, and looking at paintings by Da Vinci.  I felt as if as I read it that I was on a grail quest myself.  The movie does stay true to the book and follows the story well enough.  The actors do a believable job in all the parts, though the book Silas was a tad more crazy to me than the one on screen.  But overall if you&apos;ve read the book you might just be disappointed, as there is no real mystery left for the movie to expose.
