I&apos;ve been an avid reader of  [Loobylu](http://www.loobylu.com/)  for a few months now, She&apos;s funny and artistic and going through new motherhood pretty much at the same time I am. From some links on her blog I found a two other blogs I&apos;m going to add to my list of recurring reads.

 [Autopsy Report](http://www.autopsyreport.netfirms.com) Log of experiences as a Medical Examiner Intern - he hasn&apos;t blogged in a while, but I&apos;m sure back reading will be interesting.

 [Margeret Cho&apos;s Blog](http://www.margaretcho.com/blog/blog.htm) If you don&apos;t know her, she&apos;s a sassy, Chinese American Comedian.  One of my all time favorite people to listen to.
