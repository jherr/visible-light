Dear Friend,

I hope you will join me right now in signing an open letter to the President urging him to thoroughly reject Karl Rove&apos;s purposeful attack on the patriotism of those who dare ask the tough questions that best protect American troops.

Dear President Bush,

In the days following the 9/11 attacks, you movingly spoke of the unity of purpose emanating all across America. Now, Karl Rove, your top political aide, wants us to believe that you weren&apos;t telling the truth -- that Americans were offering &quot;therapy and understanding to the attackers.&quot; You cannot remain silent as your most senior advisor purposely twists the truth about a great moment of American unity for political gain.

It isn&apos;t the first time Karl Rove has crossed the line. It needs to be the last. I call on you to thoroughly reject his cheap, divisive efforts to challenge the patriotism of your political opponents. It&apos;s time to fire Karl Rove.

Thank you.
