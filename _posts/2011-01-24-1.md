Moving last weekend, then cleaning and unpacking this weekend.  Plus  all last week.  Today I spent several hours cleaning the old house, sewing the curtains for hte old house and right now i&apos;m taking a break from making a new coushin cover for the bay window pillow - the window being 6 feet across meaning i&apos;m working on a large piece of fabric. Actually the old house looks great - I&apos;d buy it again - well maybe not I love our new house more.  But Jack has repainted white everywhere - giving who ever buys it a fresh clean slate.  

I looked around today and decided I&apos;d miss the big back yard, and the tile work in the kitchen. I also will miss the beautiful Mantel Jack made to fit the fireplace there - and the brick fireplace - I like it better than my new black marble one.  

Well time to cut fabric and get to sewing - the sooner I&apos;m done the sooner it sells.

I&apos;m so tired - I forgot to actually blog about being tired - thus the title - I&apos;m running on empty.

LATER: Jack pulled a leg muscle and is in pain as well as tired.  I&apos;m just tired - I want to sleep for a week. - I&apos;m sore too - my hip has been both3ring me.  Oh and Mimi - is eating the thread I left on the floor from sewing today.  Damn.
