Not only did I get in a workout today but I just finished the second pair of flannel PJ bottoms for Megan - I bought the fabric back in december and cut it out with a borrowed pattern and then that was it - I set it aside and got busy with other things -well yesterday I got the first pair done and today I just did the second.  I loving this productivity swing. = hope it lasts!  Maybe I&apos;ll get my Xmas placemats done by this Christmas!

UPDATE:  after some technical difficulties with a thread change I finished the 3rd and final pair of PJ bottoms for my girl.  And we played with the paper cutter.  Now Megan and I are making bread (braided honey french) and then I&apos;m making oven fried chicken! YUM!
