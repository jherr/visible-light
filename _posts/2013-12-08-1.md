<br />Mom, 

Has it really been 14 years since we last talked.  I can&apos;t believe it. Probably because I often, daily even, talk to you in my mind.  

I&apos;m always keeping you up on Megan&apos;s development,  from a sweet beautiful baby into the tall confident woman she is becoming.  

I&apos;ve tried to keep your lessons apart of my life.  Tried also to be like the mother you were, but also be my own type of mother.  

I miss our talks,  and all our adventures.  Now I get those moments with my own girl, I get to feel a bit of that again.  It is wonderful.

I love you mom.  and I really miss you.  Sometimes I still can&apos;t breath when I think about you being gone.

your loving daughter
Lori
