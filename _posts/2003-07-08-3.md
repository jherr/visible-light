so we got Megan&apos;s car set checked today at the CHP office.  First she looked over my installation and said it was great.  Then she took it all out and apart to just to get the seriel number and date of manufacture off the front of the seat.  then she had to reinstall it.  All while Megan went from Happy to be sitting in the sun to crying.  But at least I know I&apos;ll be up for installing it when we go see dad on the 23rd.

Gymboree afterward made up for it but she&apos;s now tired and napping and so  should I.
