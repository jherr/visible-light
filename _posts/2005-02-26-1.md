I eat chicken.. I admit it.  Jack and I gave up all meat cold turkey in 1993, and were good faithful, vegetarians throughout our trip to Oz, and our move back here.  When I got pregnant with Megan in 2002 I craved Chicken so badly I actually gave in and ate a few chicken sandwiches.  I gave it up again when Megan was born and was happily reformed until I had my gallbladder out.  Basically I was running to the toilet, frantic and multiple times a day - not easy with a baby, who is demanding attention.    I remembered back to pregnancy and how the chicken had bound me up and gave it a try - sweet relief.  So now I&apos;m a chicken eating vegetarian.  Vegetarian on most days with a few days off for some chicken relief.  I&apos;m enjoying it all alittle too much too.
