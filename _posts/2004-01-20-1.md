Megan started on Sunday with a stomach flu and I came down with symptoms last night late.  Hopefully we are both on the mend.

My sick bed reading today was to finish The Da Vinci Code, a Christmas gift from the Bolducs.  It was a wonderful novel and I can&apos;t recommend enough.

If I had more energy I&apos;d put a link to the title for you but I need to lay back down soon.
