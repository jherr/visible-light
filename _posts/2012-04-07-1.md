A friend has been suffering from anemia.  Another friend told her to cook in cast Iron pans.  This stuck with me.  My mom used cast Iron, but I had never bought any and had none.  Then I started watching the [ Pioneer Woman](http://thepioneerwoman.com/)  and she always cooks with cast Iron.  So when I was out a few weeks ago and found one, I bought it.

Cut to several sauces, scrambled eggs, and last night the best bread rolls ever cooked/baked in it, and today I went and bought several more.  What an amazing tool - easy to clean (easier than teflon and not as scary).  

I&apos;ve also started grinding my own burger meat.  But that is because of the stories of pink slime.  I&apos;ll keep doing it because the flavor is so much better.
