Not really.  Its just I tend to update my facebook status so often I feel like I&apos;ve been blogging.  Not fair to those not on facebook (Dad!).

Keeping busy with the Parent run Art Program at school  and helping Megan&apos;s teacher level books using a new leveling system.  I&apos;m holding my breath on the budget cuts education is facing here in California.  I fear for Megan as they talk about getting rid of class size reductions and media teachers, along with other special teachers, Assistant Principals, busing, and Staff.  Education is changing and fear not for the better.   I actually wrote letters to the governator and all state representatives, but education seems to be on the hit list.  Our local school district cut 7 million last year and now is looking at cutting  at least 4 million more this year with additional 3 million and 2 million in the following years.  Its not a big district, so basically were already  bleeding.    There is no fluff left to cut.
