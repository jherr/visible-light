the other night Jack and I watched the series premier of the Lyon&apos;s Den with Rob Low followed by another warped episode of Carnivale.  Afterwards I told Jack I didn&apos;t know about either because they were so dark.  Yesterday I was watching the season premier of Third Watch and I realized that I watch way to much dark dramas.  So its time to Lighten up - I&apos;m going to be canceling some season passes on Tivo  I&apos;m just not sure which shows to give up.  I think CSI Miami is first on my list as I don&apos;t really care for David Carriuso.  Navy CIS is next cause its not really that good and Mark Harmon will always be Ted Bundy to me.
