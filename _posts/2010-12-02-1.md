Our house is a sad place right now.  Princess Megan&apos;s dear hamster and friend is dying.  We know she is dying and it may take a bit of time but it is happening.  She can&apos;t open her eye&apos;s anymore and she can&apos;t climb.  I took her wheel and ledges out of her cage today and moved everything closer to her.  Megan is near tears knowing that her dear friend is dying but what to do.  2 years ago this hamster was new and vibrant - even a month ago she was running around the house in her ball.  Now she can hardly move - perhaps these smaller friends are not worth the pain of loosing something you care about. Or maybe its just very hard to see your child grieve.   I&apos;m not sure we will get another hamster.  Megan might decide she wants one but right now, I&apos;m wishing we had gone with the tarantula she originally asked for.   <br />
