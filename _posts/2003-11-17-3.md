Megan loves to eat ... Pizza, grilled cheese, Earth&apos;s Best baby food  - potato and green bean dinner, yogurt, grapes, and soy beans wide noodles with tomato sauce and rice noodles. and apples when she&apos;s sharing with Jack - she won&apos;t share with me.  Oh yeah and goldfish and cheerios and bread.


she&apos;ll sometimes eat rice, white or yellow or mexican; boca burgers, apple sauce, pb&J, french fries, refried beans, lentils, tofu dogs, peas, garlicky potatoes

that&apos;s all.  I can&apos;t get her to eat anything else except the above list.  and lately she won&apos;t even eat the maybes.
