currently on heavy rotation on my ipod is the new album from the  [The Dixie Chicks](http://www.dixiechicks.com/)   Bless them! I love this album - it has my sentiments almost spot on - I to am mad as hell with the Bush administration and all the illegal crap, the huge deficit  the forgotten war in Afghanistan where we should have kicked butt, and of course the war in Iraq - course no one has sent me death threats.  I have all the more respect for this album because they aren&apos;t backing down.  I particularly like &quot;Not ready to make nice&quot; and honestly why should they.

Anyway - if you haven&apos;t heard it I recommend it - give it a listen.  Really great album from some great artists.
