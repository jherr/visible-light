Megan lately has been going to bed happily - for nap or night time, but then plays until I come in again and remind her to sleep.  Then she almost immediately goes to sleep.  She really is so cute.

We went and got her hair cut today.  She was such an angel for the lady, sat in the little yellow car and watched &quot;Land Before Time&quot; while the hairdresser quickly cut off all the split ends and gave her bangs again.  We spend the next 20 minutes playing with all the toys -- the play house and slide.  Megan actually had a great time.
