Activities in Florida have included - Disney - Magic Kingdom and Epcot and swimming in the hotel pool.  We also played a round of mini golf at Wintersummerland golf course.  

Since getting to grandpa&apos;s we&apos;ve shopped for school clothes, been to the Natural History Museum in Gainsville, Ormund Beach, and lots of swimming.  Megan also got to ride on her first horse.  We had a lovely birthday dinner with Mumsie yesterday at  [Ipanema  Brazilian Steak house](http://www.ipanemaocala.com/) .  Today we are having lunch with grandpa at the hospital were he works in order for him to show off one of his grand daughters.  Tomorrow I&apos;m having lunch with an old friend from Ocala, and Friday we head home.  What a great trip this has been!
