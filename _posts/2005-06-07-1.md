Megan&apos;s interest in using the potty happened while we were at Grandpa&apos;s and because we were traveling I didn&apos;t encourage it.  I let her us  the potty when ever she asked but that was it.  Now that we are home, she has no interest at all.  

So I was at lunch today with a friend who&apos;s son is Megan&apos;s age and we chatted about the whole idea of potty training and decided that since we were across the parking lot from Babies R Us, we try letting the kids pick out a potty seat them selves.  We got there and Megan&apos;s friend picked out  the &quot;elmo seat&quot; Megan spent more time looking at all available options, even played the button on the musical seat, but in the end she too picked the Elmo seat.  We got in the car and called daddy and Megan told him all about the new potty, we got home and she rushed into the house, holding the now unpackaged elmo seat.  We rushed to the bathroom where she put the potty seat on the toilet, and then she said &quot;Ok Mommy (YOU) sit there!&quot;
