I just checked and I&apos;m getting 20.13181019332162 miles to the gallon which is pretty good.  Wish it was better as gas is so expensive.  For those of you in cheaper states, I just paid 2.059 at  the cheapest gas station I could find.  Your average big brand name store is 2.199 for the basic unleaded.

what are the prices where you live? make me cry...
