I meant to blog every day of September and in the back of my brain I was sure I would get to it -and here it is September 28th and I haven&apos;t blogged since mid August - that&apos;s what Facebook has done for me.  What I put here gets posted on my Facebook page - but not vice versa - so my blog has languished.  

The summer came and went - the school year started and finally we are having really hot weather - it took till September for this to happen.  I bummed for Megan as these are the days the beach is calling out to us and so is the pool.  

Life goes on... We started a wine club and tasted 3 yummy reds last friday.  Also started &quot;Farm Fresh to you&quot; which delivers organic produce to us.  Well priced and so yummy.  Now I Need a good fig recipe.

Megan is doing really well.  She starts choir tomorrow after school, started a new dance class 2 weeks ago and is loving it, and will have a few horse back riding lessons in the near future (mom needs to get that going).  

I&apos;m quilting my first blanket - not large but time consuming.  Jack has been woodworking - he found a place that sells old wood cheap and built a beautiful desk for himself out of 500 year old redwood planks.
