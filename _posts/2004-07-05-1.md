We just got back from the Giants game (vs the Colorado Rockies) and what a way to see the game.  Jack&apos;s company owns one of the boxes, and we enjoyed hanging out with his work crew while watching the game and eating great food.

It&apos;ll be hard to go back to cheap seats, for our next sporting event.
