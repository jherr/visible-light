One day to plane flight and turns out we leave an hour earlier than I remembered so... that means I won&apos;t have much time in the morning for last min. prep.  Today I had to pick up a life vest for Megan so she can safely go boating next week, she&apos;ll love it its bright orange and has lots of the buckles she loves to do up.  

I also wanted to mow tonight which I just finished.  I have a gardener for the front, but with the dogs we&apos;ve learned its best to handle the back ourselves.  Well, it seems to sad to be mowing perfect rows in green grass for no one to enjoy.  The sole purpose was so that when I come back its manageable.  Well Sadie will enjoy it, though she doesn&apos;t seem the least bit fazed by tall grass or short grass.

So I&apos;ve re-discovered  [FIBS](http://www.fibs.com)  and have started playing it in my spare time. If you read this and are ever on ... I&apos;m &quot;Piter.&quot; I&apos;m sure once I&apos;ve packed tonight I&apos;ll be online while I watch who gets kicked out of the big brother house and what the British version of &quot;Queer Eye&quot; is like (saw the opening credits and its freakily the same as the US version).
