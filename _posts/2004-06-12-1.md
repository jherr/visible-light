Something big has nested in our eucalyptus tree. Not sure what type of bird it is. Jack had found a dead mouse in the yard a week ago, and about a month ago Sadie &quot;caught&quot; half a squirrel.  Yesterday some creature was squawking up in the tree, which made us notice the nest.  I tried to get a look at one of the birds after Megan went down last night, and it may be an owl, because it went off to hunt at sundown.  We&apos;ll try to take some pictures and figure out what is up there.
