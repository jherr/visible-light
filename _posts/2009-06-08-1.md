I&apos;ve been sick for a week.  Though I am much better and up and about, I&apos;m still congested and coughing.  So for Megan&apos;s last weekend for first grade, we spent Saturday first at the farmers market, then our friends Joe and Elizabeth came over and we went to see &quot;Up&quot; = great movie!  back to the house for some tri-tip.  Then it was a few rounds of Mexican Train dominoes.  - it was a great day!

Sunday dawned and while Jack and Megan went shopping I headed over to  [watercourse way](http://watercourseway.com/)  and enjoyed my gift certificate.  I had one hour in a tub room first and then a one hour massage.  Heaven!

I came home and Megan wasn&apos;t feeling great so we settled down for a few movies, some mexican train and an easy dinner.

IT was an easy nice weekend.
