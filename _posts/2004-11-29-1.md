like the cold war, Megan knowing I can trap her in her bed is enough for her to stay in and sleep.  So i&apos;ve relented and put the cover to the side.  Today at nap time I laid her down and sat at the bed reading while Megan fell asleep.  I then left her with the door cracked so that when she wakes up and escapes she can come on down.
