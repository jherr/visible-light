A couple of weeks ago I started trying to come up with a trip for Megan and myself for spring break.  Every year (2 years so far) she and I have done a road trip for spring break.  The first year we went to Hearst Castle and the second it was a northern trip to Redding and then across to the coast.  

Earlier this year my car went to Yosemite.  Some friends had camping reservations in Yosemite and their only car big enough for the trip broke down just before.  They were going to rent, but I offered my car instead.  

So its been bugging me that my car has been where I haven&apos;t been.  SO it seemed like a natural choice.  Not wanting to camp in April in the mountains, I booked us a the Wawona Hotel. And then I started researching.   I got all excited by the possibilities - there is a shuttle between our hotel and the Yosemite Valley, there is horse back riding, and if its still snowing there&apos;s a ski area.  EXCEPT ...

The shuttle only runs from Memorial Day on,  Horseback riding doesn&apos;t&apos; start until end of April, and Skiing stops at the end of march.  - oh and the pool won&apos;t be open (its outdoor after all) So now I&apos;m back into the research - looking at easier hikes and things to keep us busy.  

Add to all this that my cell phone won&apos;t work near the hotel, and there is no TV or Phone in the room.  What else???
