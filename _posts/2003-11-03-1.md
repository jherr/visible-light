To bump Miami from 2 to 6 API (or 7 Couches Poll) is just wrong.  Miami was number 2 lost ones and got moved below Florida State - Please.  I understand that we would be moved down - As Jack says &quot;we got schooled&quot; - but to get knocked out of the top 5 just shows how much those that make the polls loath Miami and take the first opportunity to dump us.  Its like each year that we&apos;ve won the national championship - the very next year we start out in some other spot than 1.  

Well I&apos;m still proud to be a Miami Hurricane - its a great team and a great school. Who cares what the damn polls say.
