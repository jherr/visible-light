Film club was this morning,  The movie was  [Sidekick](http://www.sidekickmovie.com/) .

 It was a fun flick .  I wouldn&apos;t say it was great but I enjoyed myself.  Turned out it was the only print of the movie- very small budget  (basically the writer/producer credit cards.)  He  was really funny after.  Its won a bunch of jury prizes at a bunch of film festivals.  It&apos;ll be on DVD I think June 10th.

Anyway  [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410603/)  has kind of a low score for this movie, and I will admit I liked it much better after hearing the film maker discuss how cheaply it was made.  For example - the only named star Daniel Baldwin was paid with a paper bag of cash, cast only because he was in town for something else and thought it would be a hoot.  So if your at all into superheroes or wanna be superheroes- give the DVD a rent.
