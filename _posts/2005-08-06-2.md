I&apos;ve offered to take a survey for  [some MBA students at Kellogg Northwestern ](http://www.chubbygirlbrigade.com/2005/08/ask_the_cgb_a_g.html#comments)  about plus size shopping.  Any chance to give my 2 cents on this topic i must jump at.  Don&apos;t know what they will ask, but I&apos;ve got stories ....

One isn&apos;t really shopping for plus sizes but its about what larger woman go through.  I had already found a dress to wear to a friends wedding, but needed a shawl to go with it.  I look everywhere and this was before Megan so I was able to waste whole days in malls just looking for a shawl.  I was at  [Chicos](http://www.chicos.com/store/home_intro.asp) .  Now i Knew going in chico&apos;s carried smaller sizes but a shawl is a ambiguous article of clothing and any size should have fit me. I went in and wondered around trying to find the scarf i&apos;d seen.  I made it all the way to the back of the store when a store clerk stopped me and said &quot;We have nothing in your size in this store&quot;  

No-- Hello can I help you, no --excuse me are you looking for-something in particular - just a flat out you don&apos;t belong here.  I replied as loudly as I dared, so all the patrons could hear that I was just looking for the scarf on display in the window, the clerk made no move to help me and i said well I guess you don&apos;t want my money - and left.  I now loath the sight of any   [Chicos](http://www.chicos.com/store/home_intro.asp)  though I&apos;m sure this was just one employee in one store, its enough to make me never shop there even if I lost weight or they started caring more realistic sizing.
