We&apos;ve been buying at great expense fresh squeezed OJ at the farmers market and when we got a bad batch I was turned off to it.  But going back to the store bought pasteurized stuff was just not working.  None of us have drunk any of that.  so On an impulse last week I bought a little citrus juicer.  and this morning I cracked it open along with the 10 lb bag of oranges we got at the same booth at the farmers market and wow - incredible.  Megan drank 2 glasses.   - we all did .   so easy too - really took very little time cut them open and juice each half.  I could see doing it almost every morning.  

Next I&apos;m going to juice so lemon juice for some fresh lemonade - yummy
