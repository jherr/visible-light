I spend a bit of time every day just reading my favorite blogs and sites.  I thought I would compile a list of my favorites but not put them in any order.  I won&apos;t include usual reads like Jack&apos;s blog, or CNN.  Just some you may or may not have discovered in your surfing...

1.   [The Daily Coyote](http://dailycoyote.blogspot.com/)   A blog from a woman who&apos;s adopted a coyote and is raising him with her cat in the middle of no where.  Excellent read and great pictures of cuteness.

2.  Every sunday I read my dose of  [Secrets](http://postsecret.blogspot.com/)  at Post a secret dot com.  I&apos;m tempted to send one in but I don&apos;t really have any secrets.  I pretty much tell any one everything.  

3.   [Panda&apos;s Thumb](http://pandasthumb.org/)  provides me with my daily news about evolution.  

4.   [The Disney Blog](http://thedisneyblog.com/)  gives a great bit of disney news.
