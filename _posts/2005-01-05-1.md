Over the years I&apos;ve had lots of friends.  Those that meant the world and some I&apos;ve almost forgotten. Most i&apos;ve left on good terms, with promises to keep in touch, and every so often I search online to see if I can keep that promise and touch base again.  I think aback and remember friends who were so influential.. who helped me steer my course and find my way.  There were those that instructed and those  just were there.   I&apos;ve been very fortunate with the friends of my life. Oh i&apos;ve had those in my life that took advantage of me and or have been so needy its exhausting.  And i&apos;ve had relationships with people
