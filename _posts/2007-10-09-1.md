The break is healed.  I saw the x ray this morning and the fracture on the bottom of the bone is gone and the complete break on the top is back together, though that part of the bone was lighter in color then the rest of it, so I&apos;ve been instructed to limit weight on it and go gradual.  I have to wear the boot for 2 weeks.  I go back in for more x rays on the 23rd and if all is well I&apos;ll be able to walk out in my normal shoes (though he is threatening me with orthopedic ones)

I still am to use the crutch for a couple more days but can taper off it as I feel my muscles gaining strength.

My leg hair had never been so long (a fact I quickly remedied when I got home) and the sweat had pooled on my heal basically rotting off all the callus i&apos;d built up. I&quot;ll probably stick to a sock in the boot to try to keep the oder down and the foot dry. - these boots are made out of padding that doesn&apos;t really breath so it&apos;ll be really nice to take it off all night long!
