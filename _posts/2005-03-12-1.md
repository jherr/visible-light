I finally watched  [Victoria & Albert(2001)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0262995/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0xMDAwfHR0PTF8ZmI9dXxwbj0wfHE9dmljdG9yaWEgfHJzPWN8aHRtbD0xfG1vcmU9dHQ_;fc=6;ft=852;fm=1)  which I netflixed almost 2 months ago.  I started it last night with the idea that i&apos;d watch alittle each night, and before I knew it, it was 1:30 am.  I turned it off and fell asleep until 7am when Megan woke me up.  Once I got her happy with Juice and Jungle book, I pulled out the portable DVD player and finished it.  I&apos;m glad to send it back, but man I&apos;m tired.
