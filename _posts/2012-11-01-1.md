Our Halloween was our best.  Our decorations were great - we forgot to take evening pictures but here are a few of our decorations I took yesterday afternoon.   At night there was light coming out of the coffin and we had a fog maker going too.  Add a collection of scary sound coming from the house and our decorations were our best yet.

And here&apos;s my girls in their costumes -

I made this one - I took a pair of long underwear and added fur, tail.  We made the tutu and ears and paws. :)

Mimi got a dye job at the groomers to look like a zebra/tiger.  :)
