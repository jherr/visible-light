With today&apos;s swim of 2 miles, I only have 1 more mile to go in the swim.  I can&apos;t believe I was scared I wouldn&apos;t have time to finish.  

I will have 25 more days at the pool till the deadline so I might try to swim it again - My typical swim now is 1.5 miles with a couple of 2 miles swims a week usually.  Though I planned to cut that down to just once a week, Even then I should be able to do it again if all 25 days are 1.5 miles.  We&apos;ll see - maybe I can do the swim twice.
