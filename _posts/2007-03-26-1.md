I took Megan to see a local High school production of Beauty and the Beast yesterday - the same one Jack took her too a week ago.  We stopped and bought a bunch of flowers on the way and after the play Megan gave them to Belle.  I think Megan was a bit disappointed that the girl who played Belle didn&apos;t remember her, but its not surprising given how many little girls were vying for her attention.  As for the play it was well done for a highschool production.  It was a tad long and some of the performers seemed out of sorts.  My favorite was Lumiere and while Jack went on and on about Gaston, I did think he did a good job but the kid gave me the creeps.  Probably means his performance was spot on - just not my favorite.

On the way to school this morning we passed a billboard for the play and she asked to see it again.  Very cute but she was a little bored yesterday so I think we&apos;ll wait until  [Star Struck ](http://www.starstrucktheatre.org/) puts in on in August.
