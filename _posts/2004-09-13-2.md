I was approached today in a parking lot of my favorite grocery store  [Trade Joes](http://www.traderjoes.com)  by a woman looking for a hand out.  She said that she needed some money for her and her to girls to stay at a motel and get some food, til thursday night when they would get a bed at the local shelter.  Could I help her out with anything.  I said no sorry, I wouldn&apos;t give her any money but I had just shopped and would be happy to give her some bananas for her girls.  She said well would you buy me and my girls lunch from TOGO&apos;s (a sandwich shop right next to the grocery) - No I said but you can have some bananas.  She said nah - just your prayers than.   To me she proved that she really wasn&apos;t desperate.  If she had been bananas would have been great.  She looked really clean and was wearing a little too much make up.  Her two daughters were no where to be seen.

It just cracked me up, like my friend Barbara&apos;s story of how after dinner one night she was ask for some money by a bum in LA.  She said no but you can have my left over salad.  To which he replied &quot;what kind of dressing is it?&quot;
