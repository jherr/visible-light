This was just sent to me ... read at your own risk...

&quot;The Center for Disease Control has issued a warning
about a new virulent strain of Sexually Transmitted Disease. The disease
is contracted through dangerous and high-risk behavior. The disease is
called Gonorrhea Lectim, pronounced &quot;gonna re-elect him.&quot;

Many victims contracted it in 2004, after having
been screwed for the past four years. Cognitive characteristics of
individuals infected include: anti-social personality disorders, delusions of
grandeur with messianic overtones, extreme cognitive dissonance, inability
to incorporate new information, pronounced xenophobia and paranoia,
inability to accept responsibility for own actions, cowardice masked by
misplaced bravado, uncontrolled facial smirking, ignorance of geography
and history, tendencies towards evangelical theocracy, categorical
all-or-nothing behavior.

Naturalists and epidemiologists are amazed at how this destructive disease originated only a few years ago from a bush found in Texas.&quot;
