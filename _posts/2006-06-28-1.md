I stayed up pretty late for me - till after 11. so I figured i&apos;d have a hard time getting up in the morning - and here it is 4:20 am and I can&apos;t sleep - actually I feel like its 7 am and I&apos;m raring to go - very strange - usually when insomnia hits i feel like shit and just want to sleep.  

we&apos;ll see - if i&apos;m still awake in an hour and a half i&apos;ll head over to the pool to swim.  I can&apos;t imagine being alert at superman tonight if i don&apos;t get more sleep sometime though.
