Six months of Trying, six months of 2 trips a month to my gyn, six months of messing with my hormones, and nothing to show for it.  We&apos;re taking a much needed breather - letting my body settle back into normalcy.  - then we&apos;ll see.  We&apos;ve got alot of company coming through summer and it would be nice not to be thinking about my uterus for that.  So until further notice we&apos;re taking a much needed break.
