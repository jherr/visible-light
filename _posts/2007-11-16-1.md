I&apos;m lucky enough to live in San Francisco which has draws for both my brother&apos;s work.  This week Doodlebug came calling.  He was here for a big conference in the city, and we spent all day sunday together.  We managed to walk on the golden gate bridge which I&apos;ve never even attempted because the parking lot is always full - the benefit of having a temporary handycap placard, I had spots to park now.

We also tooled around Sausalito, and watched  [ Ebisu ](http://www.ebisusushi.com/)  but alas it was closed so we went to one 2 doors down which was cheap - and just ok.  (Side note - we had a wonderful new years eve at Ebisu with some very drunk sushi chefs and 2 very good friends - like 7 years ago - maybe more.)

Doodle was busy during the week, and he missed giving us his money during Poker night, but when the conference ended he and his two co-workers took bart down to UC and we all hung out with Jack and Mel and 3 bottles of pretty darn good wine if I do say so myself - I picked them out - based entirely on the names -  [Justin](http://www.justinwine.com/)  in honor of my sweet nephew, another called Firefly from the central coast.  I can&apos;t remember the third and i&apos;m too lazy to go find the bottle in the recycling.  

It was great seeing my dear D Bug, I only wish we lived closer so that we could see the whole Bug family.
