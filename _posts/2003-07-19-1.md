I guess its a sign that I planned it all very well, but I have nothing to do with Jack&apos;s party this afternoon.  I can&apos;t pick up the cake til 12, or the rest of the food til 12:30, and the corn dish I made still has at last 30 mins in the office - so I find myself with lots to do and yet I can&apos;t do anything Yet -  I can&apos;t even decorate til 1 - :)

It should be a great party! I&apos;m looking forward to it.
