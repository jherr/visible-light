Megan is 4 today - I can&apos;t believe it she&apos;s grown up so fast.  We took cupcakes to school today and they had a little party at snack time. Then we had lunch with one of Megan&apos;s friends and her mom.  Home for quiet time and then Megan opened all her gifts.  Thank you grandpa and mumsie for the books, and Uncle Doodle bug and Aunt Missy, Justin and Elizabeth for build - a bear!.  Thank you Tia Jenny and Uncle Bomb, Cooper and Jack for the princess pillow and the princess towel.  She got lots of neat prezzies from her friends and we gave her a movie, some slippers, a pop-up castle and Jack&apos;s space ship console.  

After playing and then watching  [her new movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097757/) , we headed out for Sushi at her request.  Daddy and his girl then headed over to get Ice Cream while I went to get supplies for our playgroup halloween party tomorrow.
Too much party - she just woke up throwing up - I guess the party will have to move from our house.

i&apos;ll update later.
