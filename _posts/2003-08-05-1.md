Megan and I have managed to really spread out and move in.  Now I&apos;ve got to figure out where all our stuff is and get it put in either the suitcase or the box.

I&apos;m looking forward to heading home, though I&apos;m going to miss dad.  I miss my bed and being able to roll over with out the creaks of the old rope bed.  I will miss swimming everyday, but plan on inviting myself to join my friends Kari and Derrek at their pool.

Good book recommendation  - Following Foo by BD Fong.  Be prepared to cry.
