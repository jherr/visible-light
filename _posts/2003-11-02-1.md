Once again I have a looming trip and I&apos;ve gotten a cold.  this time I blame the flu shot - which since i&apos;m the only one sick I think is a definite possibility. Jack&apos;s been a big help today keeping the wiggler occupied while I tried to rest.  

I did see a great movie yesterday while the cold was just beginning to brew.  &quot;The Station Master&quot; was a great laugh.  I recommend it whole heartedly.   

So this week is rest and packing.  Megan is probably out of luck for Gymboree tomorrow - unless I&apos;m feeling a whole lot better.
Hopeful by tuesday I&apos;ll be up for game night at the mothers club.
