I think I can recite the entire movie Finding Nemo by heart.  Its the only movie Megan will watch and with this cold she&apos;s managed a few more viewings.  I tried Bug&apos;s life yesterday for my own sanity, but as I sat watching it while the Grasshoppers came for their food, Megan had wondered off and was destroying her room.  Today I tried Monster&apos;s Inc and we didn&apos;t even get to the factory before she lost interest and moved on.  So were back with &quot;Emo&quot;  It is a cute movie and there are worse things I could be wasting my memory cells on.

On the cold front she is still plugged up.  But I think she&apos;s feeling better.  We might even be able to go swimming by Sunday.
