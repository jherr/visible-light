Last night I took a class in wire wrapping - this is a part of jewelry making.  I took an earing making class a while ago but this was really a natural extension of that.  Anyway in the 3 hour class last night I made a necklace (1 hour of instruction followed by 2 hours of actually doing it)  and then this morning I woke up and made the earrings and the bracelet to match .  

Here&apos;s a picture of the final set... (iphone quality)
All sterling silver with  [Rhyolite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyolite)  big beads and the little brownish orange ones are glass.
