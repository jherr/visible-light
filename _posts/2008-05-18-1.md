Right now Jack is talking to Pops on his laptop - video conferencing.  Last night we had a great time chatting with Casa De Newf in Katy Tx, and Grandpa Cutherell  in Ocala Florida.  The kids shared toys and pictures they drew and we all chatted about our days.  Grandpa even got to show off his new Entertainment center and Island in the kitchen.  THe best part about this tech is that it cost us nothing.  - well aside from the apples we already all own and the cost of our monthly internet which we&apos;d have to pay anyway.   It really gives you such a feeling of closeness to be able to see your family members when you talk.

Life is good.
