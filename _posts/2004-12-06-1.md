the force is against me ... and that force is me.


First I flooded the garage because I&apos;d put something in the drain sink for the washing machine and forgot about it.  Once I found the mess I got it cleaned up pretty quickly, but then took a bucket that was full of water and poured it into the same sink, only it was full of lint from the dryer and paper-towels - an impromptu garbage can and so I ended up clogging the sink once more

take 2. .. .I filled the spa today with visions of a warm soak tonight... I set up the hose and set the timer for 20 mins.  When I went out to check it was only half full, so I replaced the hose and went in and ... forgot to set the timer again . so now we have a bog in our yard...It ran for over an hour longer than I think it needed.

What is in store for me tonight with Water?
