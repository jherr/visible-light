We are really enjoying our visit in Ocala.  So much to report and no energy left to blog.  Jack and I have enjoyed some much needed time together.  Thanks to my sister Robin we enjoyed a stay at a local B&amp;B called  [ The Melting Pot ](http://www.meltingpot.com/) . 

 We&apos;ve also snuck off for 3 movies after Megan has gone down for the night, but unfortunately  all 3 were flat and I can&apos;t really recommend any of them, but just seeing them together made them entertaining.  We saw &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot;, &quot;The Village&quot; and &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;  If I were to rank them in order of like I suppose it would be Manchurian, Village, and then Bourne which was just plain dull.  We&apos;re probably going to see Harold and Kumar tonight.  Then tomorrow Jack heads back West, while Megan and I enjoy Grandpas&apos; company for a bit more.
