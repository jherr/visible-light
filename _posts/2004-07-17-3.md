Slim Fast has fired Whoopi as their spokesperson because she has agreed to speak at the Democratic convention.  Not only is this ridiculous, but I&apos;m never going to buy there products in protest. They are headquartered in Florida and I guess are another company that don&apos;t want to piss off the Bushs. I hope they let their employee&apos;s vote for who they want. 

You know Whoopi  is a public personality and if I see her speaking on a political issue or for a specific candidate I  wouldn&apos;t assume that slim fast agrees with her.  I assume she has a mind of her own, just like the rest of us,  lets wait and see what happens in November.
