We crashed early last night, for me that meant  was out at 9 and now I&apos;m awake at 3:30.

We did managed to us the indoor pool last night and Sadie cried the whole time.  I&apos;d tied her to a table.  I think the overwhelming smell of chemicals that usually accompanies an indoor pool was too much for her.  I&apos;m not allowed to leave her in the room.  She does well in the car though so in the morning after breakfast, I&apos;ll probably leave her in the back of the CRV while Megan and I swim alittle.

on a side note,  my Pelvic Ultrasound from wed was clear.  Since my mom died of Ovarian cancer and it seems there is quite a bit of it on her side of the family, I&apos;ll be having one every year.  The radiologist said everything was clear and perfect and right where it should be.  I had scheduled the appointment a month before and had been planning it for at least a year.  In that time I had built up this dark sense of dread that Megan was going to be growing up without me.  The relief at hearing that  everything thus far was clear was so overwhelming. That will probably happen next year too.
