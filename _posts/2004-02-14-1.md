We&apos;re having a quiet day, thanks in part to the cold Megan got last week and I&quot;m now in the throws of and Jack is starting.  Jack surprised me with a beautiful bonsai, and a lovely card that is covered with Pictures of Megan and Sadie and Ripley.   I gave Jack some warm soft PJ&apos;s and Megan drew him a card and put some stickers on it.  They had a morning running around Stanford Mall, while I chilled on the sofa and emptied the TIVO so there was room for more Bear and the big blue house.

Happy Valentines day to all
