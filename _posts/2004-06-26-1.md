Saw Michael Moore&apos;s latest film, and I was fairly blown away.  Not because he presented anything i didn&apos;t already know or suspect, but that it was so well put together.  Sure he has a bias and that is felt in his narration, but for large parts of the film, he lets clips of politicians, armed forces, and Iraqi civilian&apos;s speak for themselves.  Draw your own conclusions.  

I know a great many conservative people will say its a liberal propaganda piece, but I dare them to actually see it first, then say what ever they want about it.   Sit in a theater and watch as a mother of a downed US soldier stands in front of the white house deals with the loss of her son.  Acknowledge that the soldiers that we are sending to fight in this and every war are making hugh sacrifices.   That the majority of soldiers do come from the lowest income brackets. 

This movie didn&apos;t change my mind about anything, I&apos;m a democrat and very proud of that fact (even more so now).  But it did strengthen my resolve to do everything in my power to get Bush out of office.
