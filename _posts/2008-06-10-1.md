Megan and I went to the grocery store after school today and we passed 3 stations - 2 where over 4.50 a gallon and the other usually 10-20 cents behind the others was already at 4.44 - I&apos;d say 5 dollars a gallon will be here before the summer is up and probably by July 1.

Its good though - I&apos;m thinking alot more about combining trips.  Also We are looking for a new office for Jack that is closer to home.  Right now his office is in Fremont which is 9.9 miles away.  Since we rent the space its wasteful to have an office so far away when there are plenty of closer places.  Now I just have to find him one.  Craigslist here I come...
