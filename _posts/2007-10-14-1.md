First off today was the first film club of the new season and the film was spectacular- Should be oscar worthy!  The film was  [Man in the Chair](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489225/) .  It comes out December 7th and I hope if it makes it to main stream theaters, you give it a shot.  

I rushed home, grabbed lunch and then Megan and I went to our friend Nilma and Esha&apos;s house for a Rangoli party.  Its an indian festival to celebrate colors, and its a time for Mom&apos;s and daughters to do art together.  We had a lovely time, the girls decorated murals with colored rice, and did sand stamping. Then we had some Indian snacks.  It was just a lovely afternoon with some moms and girls.
