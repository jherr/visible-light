We hit Redding at 3:30 and I decided to just head home.  The thought of dragging out our stuff for one more night was just too much.  So we headed on home.  

The drive was beautiful through the mountains.  The fog at the top of the Siskeyou Summit was the thickest I&apos;d ever seen.  I tried taking pictures but we&apos;ll have to wait and see if any come out.

We stopped for dinner just north of the 505 turn off (north or Sacramento) and we ate for the first time in years at a denny&apos;s which was surprisingly ok.  Not as grease laden as I remembered.

Megan and Sadie cried for the last 20 mins of the drive, both are now asleep.  I was delighted to see the lights Jack had put up outside for the holidays.  He and Megan played for a big until she crashed, then he unloaded most of the car.  I&apos;ll unpack tomorrow - 10 hours behind the wheel listening to Elmo and Bear is enough for one day.
