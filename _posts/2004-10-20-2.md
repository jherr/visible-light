Check out  [the Tampa Tribune](http://www.tampatrib.com/News/MGBU3UEHF0E.html)  for why they aren&apos;t endorsing Bush when they did last time.  Its a great read.  
&quot;we find it unimaginable to not be lending our voice to the chorus of conservative-leaning newspapers endorsing the president&apos;s re- election. We had fully expected to stand with Bush, whom we endorsed in 2000 because his politics generally reflected ours: a strong military, fiscal conservatism, personal responsibility and small government. We knew him to be a popular governor of Texas who fought for lower taxes, less government and a pro-business constitution.

But we are unable to endorse President Bush for re- election because of his mishandling of the war in Iraq, his record deficit spending, his assault on open government and his failed promise to be a ``uniter not a divider&apos;&apos; within the United States and the world.&quot;
