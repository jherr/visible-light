Because Megan was out of school during the summer I didn&apos;t swim laps as often as I would have liked.  But since she started up again in early sept I&apos;ve been jumping at the chance to swim 3 days a week.  Then I got sick and missed a week of swimming.  I had started at a half mile and was working my way up before I got sick.  When I got back in the pool I barely made a half mile.  But today I did it a whole mile and in 52 minutes.

It made me giddy and stupid.  I put my pin number in the machine when I was later paying for something with a credit card.   - you don&apos;t need a pin for a credit card.  And then after I picked up Megan and was on fire cracking jokes with another mom.  

So i&apos;m not at all nervous about the swim a thon next week.
