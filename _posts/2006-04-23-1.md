I took Megan to her first play today.   [A local children&apos;s theater ](http://www.starstrucktheatre.org/) was doing &quot;Disney&apos;s Aladdin, Jr.&quot;  I&apos;ll admit my ignorance here - I always though children&apos;s theater meant theater for children.  What I didn&apos;t realize was it meant children (Teens really) acting.  

The performance was wonderful.  Very well done - very professional.  Megan was absolutely enthralled and told me at intermission that she was going to be an actor when she grew up.  At the end as we exited in a throng, she looked up at me with very sad eyes and said &quot;no I don&apos;t want to go, I want to see it again!&quot;

Any of my theater friends out there know the story of &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie?&quot;  Its their next production and I know  Megan definitely wants to go again - is it appropriate for a 3 year old?

Not the best pics - but you can see how they went all out for a kids show, and Megan mesmerized :)
