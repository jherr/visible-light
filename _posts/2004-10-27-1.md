Apparently Abortion rates have  [ increased under Bush](http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/editorial/outlook/2851283) .  This surprised me, and yet when I thought about it, it really doesn&apos;t.

I am pro-choice, but I think that while every woman should have the right to decide with her doctor, the fewer abortions preformed the better.  Surgery should be the exception if possible not the rule.    We should educate everyone and provide easy access birth control to all starting with kids in High school (and maybe even earlier these days) who are going to experiment no matter what you say.
