Megan and I spent a lovely week at  [Art Camp](http://www.muttmansion.com/wiki.cgi?MeganPictures062604_School)  last week.  We painted with brushes, cars, and fingers.  We played with Playdough and cookie cutters.  We sang songs and played in the park and had a lovely week.  In the fall we&apos;ll take a art class by the same teacher but only once a week.
