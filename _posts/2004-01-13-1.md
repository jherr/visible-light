Megan and I had a play date in the park with a friend and her mother.  The play structures are surrounded by sand.  Nola and her mom came across a used condom partially buried in the sand.  It made me want to take Megan home and give her a bath right away, but I had to settle for some wet wipes.  But I did scrub her good that night when I did give her a bath.
