On Sunday while searching through our cd collection I rediscovered a dollar store find.  Back when Jack and I were first married, I frequented the dollar store down in Cutler Ridge Mall, maybe we were dating cause Hurricane Andrew blew the Cutler Ridge Mall away and the reopened much smaller mall later didn&apos;t have the dollar store.  Anyway one of the many things I would do was buy cd&apos;s from the dollar store and then try and resell them to CD Warehouse for 5 bucks. I know not very good and I think all told they only bought 1 cd from all my attempts.  One of the ones  I was stuck with was  [David Broza &quot;Away From Home&quot; ](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000068GFS/qid=1066703305/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/102-2053372-7295322?v=glance&s=music)  Well I tried it and loved it.  Its a collection of American poetry by contemporary poets put to soulful folk music.  Its really well done and I&quot;m glad I&apos;ve re-found it.  The link here isn&apos;t for the same CD as it doesn&apos;t appear to be for sale anymore.

I definitely got my buck&apos;s worth out of it.
