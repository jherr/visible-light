The petition was a partial success - the middle school they were going to reopen won&apos;t be until the budget problems are figured out - which means probably not for a few years yet.  Class Size Reduction is still on the chopping block along with busing.  

The petition was read at the school board meeting.  At least 2 of the board members weren&apos;t keen on it I understand - but they really shouldn&apos;t complain about people voicing their opinion  - especially when the community is against theirs.  

Such is life... 

I plan on continuing the petition for the time being - CSR is still worth saving.
