This year is flying by.  We&apos;re midway through March already and forth grade for my dear girl is almost finished. And she is growing up so incredibly fast.  Right now she is using my paper cutter!, Working on a biography project on Laura Ingles Wilder. 

I worry for her school and all the schools in this district.  All the co-curricular teachers have gotten pink slips.  No music, Library, or PE.  Middle schools and will loose band and choir, and other things that keep kids interested in learning.   

One positively cool thing we&apos;ve stumbled on is Khan Academy - (http://www.khanacademy.com).  Check it out - free lessons in so much.
