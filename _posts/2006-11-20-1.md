We pulled in at 10:30 last night.  Megan had slept for most of the second flight and had woken up when they announced we were starting to land.  She got excited about seeing daddy soon, coughed alittle and then threw up on me and her blanket and doll.  She managed to miss the seat or the floor or the guy next to her.  

But hey we made it - after what was one of the unluckiest adventures to date.  My wallet getting lost and Megan&apos;s puking make nice bookends. Incase you&apos;ve forgotten - the other shitting stuff include my cell phone breaking, and us both getting sick - which I still am.

But there were highlights - seeing the cousins, riding rides, eating great food.  Seeing Mumsy and Grandpa at EPCOT and then again in Ocala was wonderful.  Megan really loves them - and told them so several times.

But being back in bed, with Duncun curled at my feet and Oso next to me moaning.  Today is going to be a beautiful day.
