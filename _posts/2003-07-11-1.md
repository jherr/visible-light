I wrote a blog about how I was a sucker for reality shows but thanks to a system crash with our service provider which meant we lost a day+ worth of updates on our wiki.  

So I had a thought as I was watching Big Brother tonight, - the editors on a live show like that must have a tough job to put  24/7 worth of stuff into a few hours worth of shows.  They can stear a show a specific way. choose who they want to do better and set up the games accordingly.  Ok I like these stupid shows but they are rigged!
