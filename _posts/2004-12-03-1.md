We left Casa Bolduc at 9:15.  After a quick stop at a drive through coffee joint, we headed out of town and were in Pendleton Oregon for gas and a park play for Megan and potty break for Sadie by 10.  The Fog leaving Walla Walla was dense and it stayed with us all the way into Oregon and beyond.  Once on I 84 we made great time, stopping once at The Dalles for lunch and potty breaks all around.  We pulled through Portland and stopped just on the other side at a rest stop before making it into Eugene.  We made it in at 4:30.

I&apos;m wiped out between the cold that I&apos;m coming down with and driving all day.  Sadie is asleep and content with dinner.  Megan and I are waiting for Pizza, before the usual, Walk, bath bed.  I did get the room by the exit so I&apos;ll be able to sneak Sadie out for potty breaks while Megan slumbers. 

Tomorrow we&apos;ll tool around Eugene, swim in the indoor pool and take it easy.  A trip to borders for a new book on tape is also on the agenda.  

Then Sunday morning we&apos;ll pull out and brave the mountain passes south.  Depending on how it goes we&apos;ll either stop in Redding for the night or just go on home.  If your curious Oregon has a webcam on the  [Siskiyou Summit](http://www.tripcheck.com/roadcams/fullcam.asp?ID=18)  which we&apos;ll be braving on Sunday.
