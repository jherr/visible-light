Jack, Mel and I saw Last Holiday.  I think I liked it more than the two men I was with.  But I do have an issue to pick.  She goes to Switzerland and goes into a clothing store and is able to try on and buy cloths off the rack - PLEASE!  As a woman of size this one scene just ticked me off.  Ok its fantasy - but a little reality of &quot;sorry miss we don&apos;t have your size ... but we&apos;ll have some sweat shop of imported workers make you some clothes for a price. &quot; Come on I got insulted at Chico&apos;s because the damn sales woman pointed out they didn&apos;t have clothes in my size.  And I just wanted a scarf!

I love Queen Latifah.  I think she&apos;s beautiful and self assured, and she really does act pretty well.  Her voice is just beautiful... though I&apos;m not a hugh rap fan I do love her ballads in Living Out Load. It was an enjoyable &quot;fluff&quot; piece... but this one scene has just absolutely burned my butt for the last week.
