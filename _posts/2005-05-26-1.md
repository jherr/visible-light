Yesterday all our new windows and sliding doors were installed.  I used to turn the a/c off everynight and turn the heat on because our house would go from 80 during the day to the 50&apos;s at night.  So while the ac kept us cool during the day we needed the heater to keep the house comfortable at night.  Last night I didn&apos;t bother doing the switch, confident in that if we needed the heater I would wake up.  When I got up this morning the house was at 68, the new windows kept the heat in and the cold out.  

We&apos;ve also noticed that we hear nothing anymore.  Before I could let Megan play out side while I cooked confident that I could hear here though all our poorly insulated windows, but now I can&apos;t even hear the dogs barking.
