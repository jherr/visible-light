Megan and I are leaving the dogs and Jack again and heading to Florida - first stop is Disney were I think we are doing EPCOT in the morning and MGM in the afternoon on the first day (skipping the countries and just doing the rides at the front).  ON the second day we&apos;ll be doing Magic Kingdom.

Then we&apos;ll head north to Ocala and spend the next 8 days with Grandpa and Mumsy.  No plans as of yet except dinner out on Mumsy&apos;s birthday.  Lots of swimming in the pool and maybe a little school shopping at my  [ favorite Florida store.](http://www.bealls.com/)
