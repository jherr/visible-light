Jack, Megan and I started going out to breakfast on the weekend a few months ago.  We quickly discovered that the good places had a wait on Saturdays and Sundays but thanks to the church going crowd there is a window before 8:30 on Sunday that means we can get in at our new favorite place Waffles without the wait.  I love breakfast out - but I won&apos;t stand in line waiting for it.

When we realized this morning that it was actually an hour later, we all busted a move - must beat the church folk.  So forgoing showers we all jumped up and got dressed and got the heck out of the house.  But as it turned out we had nothing to fear. ... seems even the church folk were running behind - when we left the restaurant at 9:15 there still wasn&apos;t a line.  Looks like a few people missed church this morning.

Its is the little things that make life so much fun :)
