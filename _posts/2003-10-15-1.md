The end of enterprise tonight gave me chills.  I sort of snoozed through the rest of the episode, though I got a laugh out of target practice.  I won&apos;t say more since Jack missed it.

Bit of a let down that West wing wasn&apos;t on tonight.  NBC web site doesn&apos;t say why they post pone it.

Then I go back to the bed room all bummed cause of no WW and low and behold that TIVO caught the bachelor - that made up for it :) hehe
