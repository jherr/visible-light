Megan is napping right now.  We&apos;re heading to a farm to see cows and such and have a picnic with a new friend and her daughter Zoe.  I&apos;m sure i&quot;ll have some pictures for the site if I remember to bring the camera.  We don&apos;t have much else planned until Jack gets home and we have to go pick up his car.
