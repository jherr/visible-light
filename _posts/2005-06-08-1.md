Its 9 am and Megan has been playing quietly for the last 20 mins or so in her room.  I love this time of the day, so much possibility to what awaits us.  Megan singing and playing in her crib, happy as a clam.  I love listening to her over the baby monitor. She counts things, and talks to piglet and tells &quot;giters&quot; (tigger) No don&apos;t do that... and every once and while she says, ok shouts- &quot;mommy, WAKE UP&quot;  So I guess i&apos;ll stop playing online and go rescue her :)
