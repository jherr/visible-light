Megan and I are on the east coast.  We flew into Atlanta tonight and are snug in a hotel near the airport.   Tomorrow morning we will make the trip to SC  to see Pop&apos;s and the rest of the family that is coming in for the reunion.

It was a fairly uneventful trip.  Megan enjoyed her first ever viewing of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; followed by half of &quot;Snow White&quot; before the battery gave out on the portable dvd player.  Then we played with a magnetic Dress up Dora the explorer which actually kept her happy for over an hour.  She even got the guy in the seat next to her to play prince for part of it.

We checked in and ordered dinner not the best but they delivered and it was cheap.  Megan is happy sleeping in the bed next to me with a chair on either side to keep her from rolling out.  The hotel is a very old Hampton Inn.  I&apos;ve stayed in lots of Hamptons and this is definitely the oldest.  For the most part they done a good job keeping it clean and fixing it up, but I had to goto 4 soda machines (on different floors) to get a drink to go with dinner and our tv doesn&apos;t turn on.  The effort of changing rooms wasn&apos;t worth it to me.

Its midnight here and I should sleep but my body say its only 9.  I&apos;m trying to catch a card game on gamesmith but no luck so far.  I can&apos;t host from here and hosts are few and far between.
