Jack left at 4:30 yesterday morning, and I figured with the limited sleep, it was a good day to chase a toddler around the  [Blue Moon](http://www.restauranteur.com/bluemoon/) .  Then we headed back and explored the Splash Zone!  Megan had a wonderful time and even choose &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; for the ride home (having not had her fill of Fish yet).

No pictures though - completely forgot the camera!
