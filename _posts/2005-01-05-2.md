I have found that throughout my life different music speaks to me and becomes such a part of me, that that music will always make me think of those experiences.  

In college I discovered  [Indigo Girls](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000027E6/qid=1104971965/sr=1-16/ref=sr_1_16/102-1073078-5847349?v=glance&s=music) .  At a time that I was questioning everything I believed, they spoke to me, of possibilities, of following my instincts, and believing in myself.  I still listen to them often, Galileo is a still a favorite.  Their music makes me nostalgic for college and all the discoveries there.

In Australia I became enamored with  [Sting](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000005IL1/qid=1104972163/sr=1-6/ref=sr_1_6/102-1073078-5847349?v=glance&s=music)  and his voice reminds me of life there.  Foreign yet familiar sums both up well.  Rhythms so erotic and yet so relaxing.  

When my mother died I was understandably  depressed.  I felt as though I was isolated, until I heard Melissa Ehterage&apos;s CD   [Breakdown](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001WRO7/qid=1104970868/sr=2-2/ref=pd_ka_b_2_2/102-1073078-5847349) .  In this music of anger and anguish I found solace. I sang and cried along with Melissa for  at least a year as  it was all that was in my cd player in my car.  Now ... I hardly listen to it, though I did pop it in last december 8th, to have a good cry.  When someone I knew was going through a tough time, I sent her that CD, because in its music I also found empowerment.

Now I&apos;m currently addicted to the sound track to  [Garden State](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002J58LK/qid=1104971233/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/102-1073078-5847349) .  The tag line for the soundtrack was &quot;Music for what ever state your in.&quot; Its just perfect background music.  Not to imposing and fits our current rainy cold weather.
