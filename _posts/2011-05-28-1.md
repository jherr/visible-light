We bought a house over twice the size of our old, in January and have not been scrimping on heating or air depending on the weather.  We have everything we had before except...

Two months ago Jack got rid of the big desktop and switched it with a imac.  

Our power bill dropped below 190.  Its been dropping each month since we moved in. But this is a significant drop. We never had a power bill that low in our old house.
