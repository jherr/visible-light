Happy Mother&apos;s day to all you mom&apos;s out there.

Today for me was perfect.  Megan slept in a bit so I actually got to watch all of CBS Sunday morning and Jack brought me coffee.  Then we headed out to breakfast and after ventured over to  [Gamble Garden](http://www.gamblegarden.org/)  in Palo Alto.  We took pictures with Megan and the flowers and had a really beautiful time.  We headed home and Megan played out in the kiddy pool and then she headed in for a nap, and I headed to our pool for some laps.  It was really relaxing and wonderful.  Once home and Megan was up, She and Jack made cookies while I cooked dinner - we had a lovely bbq in our back and then we explored the veggie garden and played in the back yard.  It was so relaxing and just absolutely wonderful.  We really have it good.  It was a wonderful mothers day.
