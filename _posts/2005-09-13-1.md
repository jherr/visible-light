Megan started School today.  She was so happy to go, so happy to say Goodbye mommy!  apparently she was the big helper of the group, trying her best to get the criers to stop and tried to help the teachers as well.  When I showed up to get her at noon she was happily playing with a mr potato head she didn&apos;t even notice me until the flash went off on the camera.  I took plenty of pictures which I&apos;m sure Jack will have up later.

For me after dropping her off it was a sudden realization that I had nothing to do... well not really but my first morning mid week without Megan.  I went up to a teachers supply store to get something I&apos;d ordered and then I got my car detailed which was really nice.  I did have a few moments of seeing the empty car seat and feeling like my stomach feel out from under me.
