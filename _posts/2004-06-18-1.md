Megan is currently enjoying a long 3 hour nap, after such a busy week, I had to take a nap myself.  We entertained 3 times this week.  Tuesday night was poker night, Wednesday Susanne and her little one Stefan came over after Little Gym for lunch and then we all played in the back yard with the sprinkler, and then Thursday I hosted a baby-shower for the first mom in our playgroup to do it again (already there are 2 more in the works).  I think fun was had by all.

We&apos;ve also had some confirmation that it is a White Tailed Kite in our backyard (actually a family of them) from one of the mom&apos;s in our playgroup who has taken a bird ID class with her work.

This quote kind of hit me today - probably because I&apos;ve been monitoring the proceedings over on Jack&apos;s Blog
