 [Why this hasn&apos;t been copied](http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20041225/ai_n16358005)  over and over and over is beyond me.  Its old news but today I was sitting in the parking lot adjacent and noticed that while my car baked in the sweltering sun, those at the court house all sat under shade - and that&apos;s when I realized that the shade was actually solar panels.  I&apos;ve known about it for sometime but to see it - wow - can&apos;t believe every mall, grocery store, etc hasn&apos;t taken advantage of all that parking to make some power - its like free money-  the lot is going to bake in the sun anyway.
