I just got back from seeing  [Thank you for Smoking](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427944/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9dGhhbmsgeW91IGZvciBzbW9raW5nfGZ0PTF8bXg9MjB8bG09NTAwfGNvPTF8aHRtbD0xfG5tPTE_;fc=1;ft=20)  - which was hysterically funny.  The only complaint was the miscasting of the sexy big titted reporter - Katy Homes just didn&apos;t cut it - she looks too young and a little deerish and she hasn&apos;t even had a boob job let alone have natural big ones - so a conversation earlier on between 2 men about her chest falls flat when the character is introduced and has well nothing.

The other flick I saw over the weekend was  [ V for Vendetta](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434409/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9ViBGT1IgVkVOREVUVEF8ZnQ9MXxteD0yMHxsbT01MDB8Y289MXxodG1sPTF8bm09MQ__;fc=1;ft=20;fm=1)  which really wowed me - it was thrilling and I was on the edge of my seat through out  - no spoilers here just 2 big recommendations!
