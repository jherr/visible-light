I saw 21 grams last weekend and House of Sand and Fog today and both were well acting incredibly depressing films.  While I think the actors did a great job I&apos;m going to  hope Johnny Depp wins for best actor for his role in Pirates of the Caribbean, he was awesome and it made me laugh which is so rare these days for Oscar nominated flicks.
