again... so now I&apos;ve gone back to the dr. had x-rays she heard something on my right side and the xrays while looking clear for the most part had something on the right side.  She thinks it maybe inflammation from coughing for 2 weeks straight but she&apos;s sending them to a radiologist to have them inspected.  I&apos;ll hear more later -  but she gave me a new cough medicine that has already started to work its magic -knock on wood I&apos;m not coughing as much. 

A special thanks to the man I love who went in late this morning in order for me to go get the x rays done.
