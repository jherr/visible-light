I went back to film club today for the first time in 3 months.  The season ended in August, took September off and well with Mel out of town in October I sort of forgot all about it.  But today I managed to remember and went and I really enjoyed the film.

It was  [The Dying Gaul](http://www.thedyinggaul.com) , written and directed Craig Lucas.  It was the type of film that seemed to be going one way, and then took a surprise turn, but then turned again when you were least expecting it.  It was very well written and acted.  Loosely its the story of Robert, a gay screen writer in Hollywood who sells his scripted to Jonathan, and the friendships that develop with Robert, Jonathan and his wife Elaine.  The mind games then follow for both the characters and audience.
