After a morning of Shrek, Megan and I are heading out for a morning of running around.  I figured we&apos;d goto the pet store and see all the animals, Stop by the natural Foods store (same mall) and look for gee&apos;s favorite sausages, and maybe we&apos;ll grill tonight for dinner.

I thought I might also take her to see Robots this week.  Pooh&apos;s movie is already gone from Ocala, and kid friendly choices are so few and far between.
