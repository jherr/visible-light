Honestly I have never been a big fan of Oprah.  Ever since I worked at B&N when she started her book club and people would rush in the minutes she announced the title to get the book.  We&apos;d be sold out by the time her show was over and for some reason this annoyed me.  But now that the  [Florida GOP](http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/politics/2008/09/15/wynter.oprah.boycott.cnn)  has called for a ban of her - I found myself subscribing to her magazine and setting a season pass on the DVR.   GO Oprah!  I support her right to interview whom ever she wants, and to throw her support behind whom ever she wants.  These people are just ridiculous.
