Yesterday at Target I got her a pair of pink fuzzy slippers, which are now her favorite shoes!  She wanted to nap in the yesterday so of course last night she wanted to sleep in them again.  After about an hour in bed I heard her yell &quot;Ahme Ahme&quot; which is her name for me so I went running back - as she has never asked for me in the night before and there she was struggling to put the slipper back on.  She looked at me with tear filled eyes and said &quot;Ahme Shoes&quot;  I couldn&apos;t help but giggle, she woke up when the slipper had fallen off.  I helped her put it back on and told her &quot;Sleepy time Gee&quot;  When I went in later to check on her one of the slippers had come off again and she was cuddling with it in her sleep.  

First thing this morning she wanted the slippers back on - first before pants or diaper or shirt - just shoes please.  I did manage to get her to agree to take them off when we headed to the grocery store.
I&apos;m sure Jack will be putting up some pictures of Megan in her new Fuzzy Pink Slippers.
