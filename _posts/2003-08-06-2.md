Long story short - cause I&apos;m running on empty in the energy department, after a long afternoon hanging out at the airport after a lunch with Dad at the airport TGIF before he headed back to Ocala, we boarded our plane, I got the car seat off my back and into the seat, Megan strapped in and the whole plane went for a shake.  After everyone was on, the captain came on and announced the plane&apos;s left engine was damaged by a services truck with a hydrolic lift.  (they ran into it) so off we went and now I&apos;m writing this at the Airport Marriot, and i&quot;m going to go collapse very soon.

We leave tomorrow through Newark instead of houston - adding an extra 3-4 hours ontop of the extra night
