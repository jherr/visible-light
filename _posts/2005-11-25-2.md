The mouse is of course back - in the pantry on the same shelf.  I have our bug man coming sometime today to take care of it, but in the mean time Jack came home from work and chased the mouse out of the closet and straight to its hole.  So now I know where the bug man can put the pellets. I did what any terrified person would do - I ran to a chair and jumped up on it.  I didn&apos;t know I could move so fast!

Megan is thankfully distracted with Sesame Street.  I really want a cat - apologies to the allergic/asthmatic husband.
