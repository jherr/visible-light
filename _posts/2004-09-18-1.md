The last two mornings when offered the breast Megan has said &quot;no&quot;.  So its official she&apos;s weaned all by herself.  I&apos;m a bit sore, the longing makes me fuller but I suppose its time.  She knew when she was ready to stop nursing.  I&apos;m looking forward to being able to sleep in occasionally now.  She won&apos;t be needing me first thing in the morning any more.
