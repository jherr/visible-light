Today was Megan&apos;s 3rd birthday Party (actual birthday on Tuesday - a school day).  We had over 9 kids (plus siblings of the younger variety.  Jack made Pizza for everyone, I made the rest of the spread and everyone ate to their contented fullness.  We had a bounce house for entertainment, and I set up a coloring project and stamping and well the kids didn&apos;t want to leave - thank goodness the goody bags enticed them out the door.

So that&apos;s where I&apos;ve been, busy planning and organizing and buying for this once a year extravaganza.  Megan had so much fun and really that made it all worth while.   I&apos;m now in that exhausted but too antsy post organization, can&apos;t believe it came off faze.  Tomorrow I&apos;ll spend some quality time with the sewing machine finishing Megan&apos;s costume (for the costume parade on Thursday! at school,) before heading to Florida to see  [my old dad](http://www.muttmansion.com/dd)  get hitched.  Its a quick trip so I&apos;m going with out Megan for the first time since her birth.
