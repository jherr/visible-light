One of our credit cards was sold out from under us to a different bank.  I was annoyed at first cause this is one of the cards I&apos;ve had since collage.  But now I don&apos;t care in the slightest.  I went today to Bank 1 to pay off  the bill, They couldn&apos;t accept payment cause the card was no longer theirs despite the bill saying to send it to them, so I went to Bank 2 and they couldn&apos;t accept payment because the card wasn&apos;t in their system yet.  

This wasn&apos;t as short and as quick as it sounds, this involved tellers asking superiors for help and everyone weighing in on what I should do.  Cut to some 40 mins later I&apos;m in the parking lot on the phone with 800 number from back of new card and was told no payment needed until next or rather first bill.  It was just an annoying convoluted mess, but honestly Bank 2 was way nicer about it all then Bank 1 so i&apos;m not so annoyed anymore - maybe they did me a favor.
