I saw  [Dogville](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/Dogville-1126569/)  this afternoon.  While I wasn&apos;t prepared for the  3 hour commitment, I have to say it was a really good film.  Disturbing and an interesting window on how other parts of the world may view us, it is also a   a mirror for which we can view human nature. 

Nicole Kidman does an incredible job as a woman on the run, taken in by a town in the American Rockies &quot;Dogville&quot; .  Like a version of &quot;Our Town&quot;, the story  scenes take place on a single set, with imaginary walls, and doors, and painted text directing us around the town.  The cast is impressive, with Hollywood legends Lauren Bacall, and James Caan.  and a cast that includes Blair Brown, John Hurt and Patricia Clarkson.  

I recommend everyone see it.  You&apos;ll Cringe  and laugh and in the end feel more aware for having seen it.
