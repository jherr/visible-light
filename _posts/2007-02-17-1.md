Last night Jack and i had a date.  Megan spent the evening at the Little Gym&apos;s parent survival night.  I made us reservations at  [Nouvelle Bistro](http://www.nouvellebistro.com/) .  Last december while shopping for an outfit for Jack&apos;s company xmas party I found a top I loved.  I didn&apos;t buy i though cause it was crazy expensive.  After the holiday I was back at the same store and it was on sale for $29 and in my size so I bought it, and have been saving it for just such a night.  Then last week, after noticing my jeans were all getting too loose (yeah me!) I bought the next size down - they didn&apos;t have the jeans in the cut I liked so I bought a pair of black pants and a pair of tan ones.  So I planned for our night to wear the cute top with the tan pants.  

The night was going fine until I got in the car and looked down - I had never sat in the shirt and when I sat the bust opened exposing me! I looked down shrieked and then ran in and changed my shirt.  We still had a lovely night - but i&apos;m so bummed about the shirt that should have been great.
