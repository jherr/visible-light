I just threw my first sourdough brick in the trash - it was dense and to hard to eat.  
I&apos;ll try again next week and i&apos;ll probably add some yeast to ensure that it actually rises well.  The starter should still make the dough sour enough.

On the plus - I canned tomatoes again today - I have 10 12 oz jars of tomatoes.  I will give a couple to the friend who gave me some of the tomatoes from her garden.  yum
