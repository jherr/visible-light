Jack and I went out tonight and for a change of pace we went to a fundraiser Cinco De Mayo dinner for  [Home At Last](http://www.homeatlast.org) , the rescue group we adopted Oso from.

The dinner was delicious, the company was all lively, the 2 animal trainers who spoke were very informative and we won a dog training session from the silent auction that i&apos;m sure Oso will love. 

They have 4 dogs in need of surgery so they had a special display and a donation bowl.  I went up to add my donation, with a very nicely dress gentlemen.  He struck me as a executive type.  I was flabbergasted when he put a 20 in the bowl and to back a 10, a 5 and 3 ones.  It was the 3 ones that got me - I mean come on a 2 dollar donation is fine but that was just too much!  I think it was because he was dress so well that the whole thing came off odd.
