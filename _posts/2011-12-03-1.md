Jack and I found ourselves with a few hours this afternoon.  We decided to go on a &quot;date&quot; hike after we dropped Megan at the party she was attending.

We chose  [Dry Creek](http://www.ebparks.org/parks/garin) , and more specifically I wanted to hike to Gossip Rock.

We made it as far as the Pioneer Trail turn off before realizing we just didn&apos;t have enough time before having to pick Megan up from her party to get the rest of the way.  Still it was an absolutely perfect day.  Sunny, Breezy and cool.  Clear skys meant views to the bay and beyond.
