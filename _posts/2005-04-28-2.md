Last night Jack and I met Mel and stood in line for 2 hours, to see the preview of the movie  [Crash](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10003654-crash/)   It was awesome.  Really one of the best movies I&apos;ve seen in a long while.  Its a thought provoking look at race relations in America.  I think everyone would benefit by watching it.
