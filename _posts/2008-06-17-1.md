Despite Jack being out of town I went a head and hosted poker monday night.  The usual gang was there with a couple of exceptions.  Jack even joined us through the wonders of Ichat.  My lap top sat at the head of the table and his chip stack sat in front of him.  We had to hold up his cards so he could see them.  And despite his kicking our asses we never once looked at his cards, or swiped his chips.  

He was the big winner for the night.  And I was the big  looser - so we broke even.
