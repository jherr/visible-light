Today&apos;s adventures included an afternoon picnic with the mother&apos;s club that I belong too - we were an hour late because Megan had been napping so there was no more veggie burgers for us, - go figure.  But it was alot of fun seeing some of the moms kids and dads from playgroup and the club.  

Onces Megan went down for her afternoon nap, I headed over to the megaplex and saw SWAT which was a fun movie, but it really was missing something.  I was entertained and enjoyed the first movie in months that didn&apos;t have annoying people talking all the way through it.  The stupid anti vegetarian scene was not appreciated by this veg head.
