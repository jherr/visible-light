Megan and I spent the last day of summer (before her school starts tomorrow) at the Monteray Bay Aquarium because last thursday they put on  [exhibit another Great White Shark. ](http://www.mbayaq.org/whiteshark/)  This one is a male slightly larger than the female they had 2 years ago.  It was very cool to see.  Megan and I really enjoy watching him swim around and we arrived just in time to watch them feed the fish that share the tank with him (barracuda, Blue fin and Yellow fin Tuna, and Bonito).  We then went over to the Splash Zone since a month ago with Grandpa and Mumsie it was too crowded to even try and play there.  Megan got her fill and then we explored the rest of the Aquarium.  Megan even sat still for a 15 minute presentation on &quot;Project: Great White&quot; in the Auditorium.  

We walked over to Pacific Grove for lunch at a great little place Called  [Archie&apos;s American Diner. ](http://www.canneryrow.com/show/xmlsite/xml-standard.xml/xsl-merchant.xsl/start_id-cjlfiapcphhaflkpkhjobjldoppbfpohjiibbelg/sub_category-jcfilmneeecipfbohhfgmhjikdlmeacjapihbaal/) 

After lunch we went back to the Aquarium and watched the shark some more.  I just couldn&apos;t get enough of this amazing creature- one we all fear and we truly don&apos;t understand.  

The traffic was kind both coming and going - I guess with kids back in school, people are staying much closer to home.
