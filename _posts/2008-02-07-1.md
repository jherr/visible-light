As i sit at my computer reading mail and news etc, a little dog has jumped up behind me on the seat and is climbing up my back to get my attention.  Ah to be so unconditionally loved!

It reminds me of a magnet on the side (stainless steal front means no magnets!) of our fridge...

&quot;I want to try and be be the person my dog things I am&quot;  So very true.
