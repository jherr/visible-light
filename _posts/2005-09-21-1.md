When  [Oso killed the snake](/vl/archives/001990.html)  it was after weeks of interest in the Rosemary bush.  He wouldn&apos;t leave that bush alone and he drove us all crazy with his determination to watch the bush 24/7.  Afterwards he never even went near the bush so I figured that must have been the snakes home.  

For the past week he&apos;s been getting anxious in the bay window as if a cat or squirrel was in the front yard, but when ever I looked there was nothing... until today.  Today when I saw him intently staring out the window just outside and under the bird feeder I looked and saw - a little brown mouse!

Oso is a great hunter.  He is really being wasted in the burbs :) though I don&apos;t mind - I figure the mice won&apos;t be coming in the house if he&apos;s this intent on monitoring them now.
