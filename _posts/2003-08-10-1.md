This third installation of the American Pie movies was my movie choice yesterday.  I laughed so hard before the opening credits, that I felt I&apos;d gotten my money&apos;s worth - it was the best marrage proposal scene I&apos;d ever seen.

I recommend it if you need a laugh and don&apos;t mind toilet humor.  Don&apos;t be late, the funnies scene is definately the first one.
