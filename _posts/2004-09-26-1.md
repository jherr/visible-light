We just finished a great  weekend.  I enjoyed saturday to myself and  went to a movie, and  saw  [ Outfoxed](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/outfoxed)  (I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll blog about it, but I was overwhelmed by it but then I never watch Fox news so I hadn&apos;t really exposed myself to their lies and prejudices).  

Today while keeping an eye on the weather channel to make sure Jeanne was moving quickly and our family is safe, Jack, Megan, Sadie and I entertained the Floods.
