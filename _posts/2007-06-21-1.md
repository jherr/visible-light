Jack told me about his sister&apos;s new favorite gadget  [The Furminator](http://www.furminator.com/testbed/indexnew.html)  at lunch, so after I headed out and bought one, got home and tried it out on Oso - Damn if the video&apos;s aren&apos;t spot on - I&apos;ve never seen so much hair come off an animal before- Our backyard now has piles of hair floating around and Oso really enjoyed it.  He turned into all the brushing asking for more.  It was amazing!

I love the picks of the animals with the hair that came off of them - the Newfie bring someone to mind .... hum who I wonder ...
