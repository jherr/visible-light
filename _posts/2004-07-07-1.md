Last night while talking long distance to my sister Robin,  got  a call on the other line.  I&apos;d been waiting all day for the vet to call on Sadie so I clicked over.  The woman identified herself as &quot;Regina with  [DYG, Incorporated&quot;](http://www.dyg.com/) , looking for Jack,  I told her he wasn&apos;t available and she asked when to call back I said LATE EVENING.  

Imagine my surprise when at 6:57 in the morning Regina called us back waking not only Jack and myself up but Megan as well.  I curse you Regina at DYG.  The best one I can think of this bleary morning is... may the flees of a thousand camels infest your armpits!
