While in Maui I broke out with small little red itchy bumps all over my hands.  I know I&apos;m allergic to Mango sap so I&apos;m thinking it must have been the soap in the hotel, but now that we are home the bumps are gone but my hands are pealing and itchy still.  I&apos;ve woken up 2 nights in a row with incredibly itchy hands. Hydrocortisone helps as does aloe but this is an annoyance.
