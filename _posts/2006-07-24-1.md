I woke up at 4 local time very very thirsty, i&apos;ve already drank 2 bottles of water (one a refill from the tap) and a carton of milk, and yet the thirst is still there.  that cheap dinner must have had more salt then i&apos;ve ever had before topped with flying.

UPDATE: The thirst has dissipated but now i&apos;m wired and need to pee.  I fell asleep around one local time and was up at 4 - yeah i&apos;m going to be tired today.  But i am so wide awake. 

I&apos;ve played some backgammon, some lemmings on the PSP and i&apos;m logged into the gamesmith site waiting on some hearts players to wake up.  Megan has stirred a bit but is still sleeping.
