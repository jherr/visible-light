I&apos;m going to swim a mile on October 7th for the Woman&apos;s Cancer Resource Center and I&apos;m going to do it in honor and memory of my mom and Jack&apos;s mom.  Swimming a mile is the least I could do for 2 such wonderful woman.

So I need  [donations :)  ](http://www.wcrc.org/swim/pledge/)  my nickname is Lori
Please give if you can and I&apos;ll swim my best.  My goal is to raise at least the $250. that the WCRC has asked of me.  With any luck (and a lot of support) I&apos;ll raise even more) Course I&apos;m sure Jack will be registering shortly and then you&apos;ll have to support too.
