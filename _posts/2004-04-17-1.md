I read &quot;Glorious Appearing&quot; this week while Jack was in Chicago. It was so bad I&apos;m not even going to link it to its Amazon page.  

I started the Left behind series while in Japan a few years back on the recommendation of Jack&apos;s sister Jenny and her husband Thom.  As a work of fiction I was pleasantly surprised at how well it read and how entertained I was.   As the series continued I got more annoyed with the repetition and the preaching (which went on for pages and pages at some point).  THe final book was atrocious.  Completely unbelievable, poorly written, badly edited and just plain dull.  

The writing pair are obviously more interested in a quick buck than coming up with a decent follow up for their first surprising hit.  Each successive book was worse than the one before it.  I promised to send my copy to my sister so I am passing this one on (otherwise I might add it to the firewood pile).  I hope she never gives it back and I hope everyone else avoid this monstrosity.   If you read the first book left behind - stop there and don&apos;t bother going on.  If you want a good book try Dan Brown&apos;s  [The Da Vinci Code](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385504209/qid=1079407434/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/102-1438961-7306517?v=glance&s=books&n=507846)  (also a recommendation from Jen and Thom)
