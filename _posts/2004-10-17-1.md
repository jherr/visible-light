Edamame! 

Megan is sick.  This time its a fever with cold and cough.  She&apos;s cranky so when lunch came and we didn&apos;t go out to eat which she wanted &quot;gogo dinah&quot; she refused everything I made for her.  From pizza bites to goldfish and even a PB&J.  All the while I was boiling up some edamame (boiled soybeans in a pod lightly salted).  When she saw them she got happy and is now enjoying a very healthy lunch.

I find this particularly humerous because quiet a few of the people on  [Dooce&apos;s poop blog ](http://www.dooce.com/archives/daily/10_15_2004.html#comments)  recommended Edamame as a cure for constipation - course I only read about a third of the now 450+ comments on the subject.
