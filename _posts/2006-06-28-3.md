I just mailed this letter in her honor...

Ohlone Humane Society,
PMB #108, 39120 Argonaut Way, 
Fremont, CA 94538-1304

Dear my friends and fellow pet lovers at OHS,

Sadie our wonderful chow mix we fostered and then adopted through OHS, passed away alittle over a week ago.  After going blind over a year ago she had been in a lot of pain, and her diabetes was getting the best of her.  She truely had been a medical miricle for the years we had her, over coming the odds and a string of ailments. 

We really miss our girl.  She protected us a guarded us as we slept, she assured we got up bright and early, and she was an expert squirel hunter and mail man scarer.  Megan, who is now 3, proclaimed as soon as she could speak that Sadie was her dog.  She inparticular has been sadden at the loss of such a dear friend.  Every one expecially our lastest rescue Oso misses our girl. 

Please except this donation [...] in honor of our Sadie Boo.  It was thanks to your hard work that she came into our lives.  

Thank you so much for giving me my â€œSadie Booâ€
