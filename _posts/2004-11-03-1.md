I netflix&apos;d the movie &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; by Henry James and watched it last night. I know the reason why I found it was it had Colin Firth in it, but his one scene should have hardly counted.  The story was dreadful and I have a sneaking suspicion that they followed the book closely.  The story was depressing and the experience was overall disappointing.... reminds me of something else... what I wonder.
