for the past few days all Megan will eat is Cucumbers.  And not just any cucumbers but our home grown english cukes cut in cubes.  Its cute to watch her crunch them... but what vitamins is she lacking if this diet continues much longer.  She did have Spinach Tortilini with Tomato sauce yesterday and banana to go with her cucumber lunch.  So overall she&apos;s eating more than Cucumber... but if she has a choice that is all that goes in her mouth.
