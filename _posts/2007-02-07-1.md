Jack and I both love to cook, and for years we delighted in cooking.  In Australia we worked on perfecting Pizza, and being Vegetarians we got really creative.

But since Megan we&apos;d hit a rut.  Lots of Pasta, Lots of pizza, Lots and lots of the same oh same oh.  But now Jack is eating meat we&apos;ve spent the last couple of weeks delighting in new foods.  I&apos;ve decided to share some of our cooking success with you, starting with Dinner tonight. 

Tonight we made Fajitas.  Since the weather isn&apos;t great I pan seared the skirt steak.  When it was done it sat covered on a plate absorbing some fresh lime juice while I cooked up the onions and peppers in chili pepper tabasco and cumin.  

I also made some fresh  guacamole.  - Let me just say this was the best fajitas i&apos;ve ever had.
