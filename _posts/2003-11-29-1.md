Jack and I really sat down and got alot of Christmas shopping done.  I only have 2 nieces left and Jack and Megan of course.  Jack is really hard to buy for as he tends to buy what he wants when he wants it.  I&apos;ve got a couple of ideas but could use alittle help if anyone out there has an idea they aren&apos;t going to use.
