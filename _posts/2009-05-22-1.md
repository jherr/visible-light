I&apos;ve been trying to let the event of monday be in the past and have tried not to let it overwhelm me.  I&apos;ve been keeping very busy at the school, ever grateful that I have a place I can throw my energies.  When I am alone and its quiet = that&apos;s when it all creeps back.  I&apos;m glad for the weekend - I hope to have lots of fun with my family.  We are watching a friends daughter saturday night - and have two girls running around and playing will be so good for reaffirming life.

Next week I have a field trip with the library assistants to look forward to - we are going to the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco.  And then friday is Gallery Night - oh what fun that shall be.    Our little art program is really so successful.  I enjoy it so thoroughly.  Just this past tuesday I helped a friend teach in one of the special Ed classes.  It was very rewarding.
