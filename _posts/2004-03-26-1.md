I got some spam today with the following text at the bottom of the message...

&quot;This mailing has been performed by Internet Marketing Solutions,
1719 University Avenue, Bronx NY 10453 USA,
in compliance with the &quot;CAN-SPAM Act of 2003&quot;,
approved and signed by the president of
The United States of America on Dec. 16, 2003.
For this reason, this email cannot be considered SPAM.&quot;

So now if Spam says its not spam its not spam.. yet it was unsolicited email sent to an account that doesn&apos;t really exist (info@muttmansion.) I don&apos;t know about you but if it smells like spam and looks like spam its spam.  Mail agreed it had filtered it into trash.  I was curious what spam there was when I was downloading 8 messages and none made it into my in box.
