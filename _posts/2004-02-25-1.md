I watched Pieces of April last night and enjoyed it immensely.   So now for the first time ever I&apos;ve watched all the movies nominated in most of the categories. I&apos;m lacking a on the documentary front and also on the short films.  Should be an interesting show.  I&apos;m planning on making my choices  in the next couple of days and posting them online.
