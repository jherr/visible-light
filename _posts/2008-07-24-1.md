My playgroup mom&apos;s and I decided we had  [same campground which is just lovely ](http://www.co.sanmateo.ca.us/smc/department/home/0,,5556687_12313309_12328487,00.html) , big redwoods in a cellphone blackout zone (no matter who your provider is!).  Fewer banana slugs then last year since we were sans rain.

With the extra day we had time to play around the campground, and explore the park.  We hiked to the creek and planned on swimming until we actually touched the water - which was ice cold.  Megan undeterred, decided to swim anyway, while most of the other kids played with rocks and just got in a short way.  We also enjoyed some great food.  We were organized this year (thank you Jen!) so meals were doled out. 

Here&apos;s our pics - Not the greatest and for some reason I never had the camera in my hand so only a few.
