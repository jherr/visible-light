Today we met our friends up at Dry Creek Cottage which is very close to Garin Park where we&apos;ve been going lately for hikes.  We got there at 9am and the cottage didn&apos;t open until 10 so we headed around it to Dry Creek Park and hiked and explored.  

This park and its neighbor Garin are both hilly and can make for challenging hikes.  We stayed with a easier hike. since our objective was the cottage and gardens.  We wondered along and discovered a cow holding area.  It was empty of cows but had 7 or 8 turkey vultures.    Megan was fascinated by the whole place - the ramp to take  the cows in and out of the truck, the cowboy walkway along side the ramp, and the turkey vultures.  One of our friends wasn&apos;t feeling good so the rest of the group headed back to the car while we explored some more.  We also wondered around an unnamed pond which was much bigger than the puny Newt Pond we hiked to last time.

Finally back at the cottage we met back up with our friends and entered the amazing gardens.  The place was enchanting.   [Head over to shutterfly for the rest of the pictures, but here&apos;s one for you...](http://muttmansion.shutterfly.com/)

I&apos;ve lived here how long and didn&apos;t know this place existed!
