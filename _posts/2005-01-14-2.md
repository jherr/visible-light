The  [ACLU](http://www.aclu.org)  is why I sleep at night and can blog about things other than politics.   This organizations sole purpose is to defend our rights.  I recently joined them and am now a proud card carrying member.

I signed a petition for them that I think everyone should sign, but rather than give out peoples emails which pisses me off when its done to me ... I figured I&apos;d blog about it and leave it all to your own conscience.  Here&apos;s the note I could have emailed you.  I urge you to go to the  [ACLU](http://www.aclu.org) 

Message:

Dear Friend,  Today some of the most powerful politicians in America are determined to undermine our fundamental freedoms and the basic constitutional principles that define our democracy. Only a large, bold movement of people like us â€“ people who refuse to surrender our freedoms -- can protect our civil liberties.  Please stand up and defend the values that are at the very heart of America. Join this movement for freedom by clicking on the postcard above to sign the pledge and proclaiming &quot;I REFUSE TO SURRENDER MY FREEDOM.&quot;  I took the pledge, I hope you will too - just goto the link above
