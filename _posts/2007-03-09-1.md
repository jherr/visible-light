Last week despite suffering from a cold I still swam at the pool all 4 days I could.  I did cut back to only 1 mile on friday cause i just couldn&apos;t breath.  Over the weekend I started to feel better and by monday I was back at 2 miles, tuesday a little over a mile and then 2 on wed.  Then wed night was the night from hell and yesterday I started feeling bad again.  My cough increased, my nose is stuffy again.  I&apos;m literally sicker today than I was a week ago.  I did get a good night sleep last night and i&apos;d hoped to feel well enough to swim, but I can&apos;t stop coughing.  So no swimming today for me.  More tv and hanging out at home for us today.
