This time of year will always bring to my mind my mom, Not just because she died on this day 4 years ago, but because as a child she always made Christmas so special.  

It was my favorite holiday. Now as I get prepared for the holidays, as a mom myself, I am constantly being reminded of her.  When  I sing Megan to sleep with carols, I remember singing carols to her with my sister Robin, as she lay dying.  She could barely speak, but she managed to directed our rhythm as we held her hand.  

 She loved the carols.  She loved going to church late on Christmas Eve, candle light and song.  It all meant so much to her.  

Oh Mom I miss you.  I ache that Megan will never know you, that I have so much to share with you, so much advice to seek and so many stories to tell.  I can&apos;t send you Megan&apos;s picture with Santa, but I can think of you often and know that you are still with me, when ever I see a zebra or an orange slug bug.  

Merry Christmas Mom, I love you.
