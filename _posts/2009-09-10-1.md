I was going to wait until the bread was actually in the oven, and I guess it is since its rising in the oven - but I&apos;ve spent the week nourishing my new pet - a sourdough starter.  

The smell at times reminds me of throw-up.  I&apos;ve had it growing in a jar on the kitchen counter - now I&apos;m relieved that its far enough along I can put it in the fridge - with a lid.  So early last week I combined one cup flour with one cup of warm water.  With in hours I had bubbles.  I kept it stirred and the next day I fed it with 1/2 cup of water and flour - I did discard half.  

every day - I repeated. and yesterday after I fed it - I realized it was ready - so today I made a sponge.  And tonight - I&apos;ve made the dough!  I&apos;m looking forward to tomorrow - here&apos;s hoping it doubles overnight.
