We had a lovely vacation in Oregon.  We stayed at  [ Windermere ](http://windermerebythesea.com/default.htm)  which was for us roughing it a bit. No phone, no wifi - but a small kitchen, a bed, a sofa for Megan and a breathtaking view!  We spent days combing the beach and playing the dunes, and evenings playing wii and drinking wine while watching the sun set.  It was so relaxing.  A total reversal on my last trip in November.

We had some really wonderful walks on the beach - one after dark when the stars where so bright, and another when we went out to cave on a rock usually covered by the tide.  We dodged the tide going out and were rewarded with a tide pool that had anemone  and little fish.  We saw some mollusks, and scallops.  Someone had beat us to it and had left a circle of pink rose petals that were washed out to sea while we were in there and so we started our race back.  

On our return from one walk I saw a seal out of the corner of my eye- I stood there letting the tide run over my feet and sure enough there it was - I yelled out and Jen, Thom and Jack were all able to see it. 
It was really cool... The next day we drove up the coast and saw hundreds of seals and sea lions near Coos Bay but it was that one that impressed me the most.

We had a lovely drive home.  Lunch in Eureka at the Golden Harvest Cafe, and a stop at the drive through tree  in the Redwoods.
