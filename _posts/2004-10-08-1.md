Megan and I headed out this morning early to Joan&apos;s Pumpkin Patch in Livermore with the rest of our play group.  It was the first time I&apos;d driven to Livermore since we&apos;d moved here and I went out with Jack&apos;s Mom and Carlos to the labs there.  From our house you have two choices for routes.  Either out of the way but freeway all the way or the direct windy mountain road.  I choose the later this time as I had that first time, and the drive is so beautiful.  Very different in October after a long dry summer than it was that January during the rainy season, but still beautiful.  The Pumpkin Patch had lots of animals to feed and pet, some fiberglass animals to climb on, the ever important &quot;op un&quot; (popcorn).  Megan had such a good time that when I tried to get her to leave to go to lunch she didn&apos;t want to.  

We had a lovely lunch with 2 other mom&apos;s and 2 of Megan&apos;s friends.  Then while Megan was kept awake with a dvd in the portable player, I enjoyed the drive back (which as usual seemed so much shorter coming home than going!)
