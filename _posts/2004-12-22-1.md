last night and this morning I&apos;ve been doubled in back pain.  I used a heating pad and have been in the spa twice which helped and with the advil I took this morning I should be back to new shortly.  It only dawned on me this morning that the pain is probably cause from pulling a 40lb dog over a six foot fence by his collar.  OK next time - he stays in the neighbor&apos;s yard till they get home, or Jack does.
