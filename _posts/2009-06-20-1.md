Grand Canyon day 2 was spectacular.  We spent the morning on board  [Grand Canyon Airlines](http://www.grandcanyonairlines.com/) .  Jack is working on some way to mix our 3 different camera pictures.  Megan alone took over 100 pics!

We then headed over to the park and took Megan to the ranger station where she could find out how to be come a Junior Park Ranger.  We got [ the pack](http://www.nps.gov/grca/forkids/beajuniorranger.htm)   and then after watching a very funny ranger talk on Geology, we headed to the Rim and Megan completed her booklet. 

We returned to the station and she was sworn in, and was so proud of her accomplishment! (as we all were!)

We headed to the village for lunch with the hiking Bolducs and then we all loaded up in their car and headed over to the Tusanya Ruins.  We went did a bit of shopping, picked up dinner and headed back to the hotel to hang out for our last evening together.  

This morning we woke up and headed out to Flagstaff.  Our flight wasn&apos;t until after 1 so we headed over to the  [Lowell Observatory](http://www.lowell.edu/) .  We parents sure know how to bore our daughter.  Jack and I really enjoyed ourselves though and we got to see the telescope that discovered Pluto and also helped map the moon before the apollo missions.

The flights home were uneventful, and our dear friend Penny picked us up from the airport, and we made it home in time to eat really hot thai food.  Good night all - time to clear the TIVO!
