Megan is still asleep. After the 4:30 am wake up yesterday I&apos;m amazed.  She was down at 7:30 last night so that&apos;s officially 12 hours so far.  Normal for her at home but more than I could hope for on the road.  The only draw back is Sadie has her legs crossed.  I tried to get her to go potty in the tub but she looked at me like I was stupid.  She keeps pacing between the window and the door, each time she passes the bed she gives me the dirtiest look.  One little bark would wake her up, Sadie, but we can&apos;t leave until Gee is up and I&apos;m not going to do it :)
