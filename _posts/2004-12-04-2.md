Megan fell today while we were walking Sadie.  She was running to join us and tripped giving herself a bit of a black eye.  She cried for about 3 minutes before turning back into &apos;Happy&apos;. She&apos;ll have the shiner for a couple of days though.

She got into other mischief too - like flushing a bar of soap down the toilet, along with wads of Kleenex.  She dumped out a bunch of pretzel crumbs on the bed, and managed to hide the tv remote. (i&apos;m hoping it didn&apos;t join the soap).

We head out in the morning.  I already loaded some of the car after Megan went down tonight.  I doubt we&apos;ll make it all the way home tomorrow - as Mapquest puts that as an 8 hr drive, We&apos;ll probably stop in redding again, though that La Quinta doesn&apos;t have internet.  I watched Gangs of New York tonight - or at least the first half... I didn&apos;t know it was a 2 dvd movie so I&apos;ll be finishing that one at a later date.  Thought it was funny that they split the movie just as the 2 leads finally had sex.
