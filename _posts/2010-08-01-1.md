We started out today thinking lets ride around the neighborhood.   We headed out first riding over to a friends house.  We stood in the street chatting and the kids all rode around us.  We then headed out of our neighborhood and biked all the way to our friends house.  We again stood chatting and then Jack and I started talking about him running over to a restaurant to get us lunch.  My friend over heard and said she and her kids would jump on their bikes and we could all go.  So we all headed further north to the local mall where we had a great lunch on a patio of a sandwich shop surrounded by our bikes.  We headed back to our friends neighborhood park and then after a rest we headed home.  All told I biked 7.42 miles ...

Jack was sure we did about 3 - I said it was over 10 and closer to 15 so we were both wrong.  which cracks me up.

I&apos;m tired and my butt hurts - I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever biked that far, but it was a perfect day, and I&apos;m very proud of myself and I love my new bike.  [ its a Townie by electra and it is cool!](http://www.rei.com/product/803022?preferredSku=8030220019&cm_mmc=cse_froogle-_-datafeed-_-product-_-8030220019&mr:trackingCode=9B19CE29-B020-DF11-9B13-0019B9C043EB&mr:referralID=NA)   (its green not the orange in the picture).  Its cool cause I peddle forward of my seat not below it and I feel like i&apos;m biking on a tropical island. - very relaxing.
