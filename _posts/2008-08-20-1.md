I spent college drinking, until I turned 21 and then it stopped being fun because there was no challenge, I could go anywhere and get a drink I no longer really drank except occasionally - until we moved to Oz and I tried to keep up with the Aussies.  I totally think  [University Presidents ](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/california/la-me-drinking20-2008aug20,0,1651220.story)  are on to something.  Sure there will still be drinking - but if its no longer illegal and taboo - then it will loose some of its attraction.  And it just makes since to move the age to 18.  If your old enough to vote and die for our country then you should be old enough to drink.
