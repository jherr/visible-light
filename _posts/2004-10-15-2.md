Insanely great restaurant to recommend - Tonight I went to a baby shower at Salang Pass at 37462 Fremont Blvd., Fremont, CA 94536 - they have no website.  Its Afghan food in the heart of an area near us called little Kabul.  I had the pumpkin spice with rice and dal soup and I split a delicious appetizer that was potato and veggies in a stuffed flat bread.  Everything was so flavorful and not terribly spicy.  If your ever out this way, I recommend it and let us know ahead of time and I&apos;ll get a babysitter for Megan and join you.
