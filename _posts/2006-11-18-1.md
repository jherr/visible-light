Grandpa Mumsie, Megan and I went to see Happy Feet yesterday.  It was a bit long but overall cute movie.  Megan however hated it. She squirmed and wiggled, she talked and talked and in the end said that was  not a good movie.  I think the trouble was that she just didn&apos;t understand why the other penguins were being mean to the little guy with the blue eyes.

We had a lovely Dinner at Thai Ruby here in Ocala, which I topped off with Thai Donuts - little balls of happiness not available on my coast at all!
