John Kerry has a  [plan](http://www.johnkerry.com/plan/) , a good one too.  Until tonight I was voting for John Kerry more because I wanted to get rid of Bush,  now I know I&apos;m voting for a great man and a very capable leader.  Kerry really impressed me tonight.  He was articulate and decisive, looking more presidential than our current leader who stumbled and staggered.    

now i just wish I could sleep - there is electricity in the air.
