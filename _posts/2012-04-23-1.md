Yesterday we got a garden in - a whole wonderful garden.  We had grass outside our dinning room window which when we moved in I thought boring and ugly.  So I had Jack remove the grass and then I bought a couple of plants and the weeds took over.  and it stayed ugly.  Then last november I had Nephew lay down black plastic and it sat till this weekend.  We removed the black plastic, raked up the dead weeds, removed the dead plants that were miss placed ( full sun when shade lovers are needed).  Then we went and bought a bunch of plants - put them all in, put down weed guard and then bark - 2 stepping stones we bought at the school auctions in the past few years finished it off.

i&apos;ll post pics later - but its so nice to look out and see beauty.

We got to try out a friends pool yesterday too, and then Jack made Pizza - and we tried it in the cast iron pan and on the grill.  The cheese didn&apos;t get brown so he stuck it under the broiler and it was delicious.  He switched to the oven for the second pie and it didn&apos;t have the flavor of the grilled one - so our pizza just got more complicated - but it is so worth it.
