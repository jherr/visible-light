I&apos;m not proud of it, but my current project is to get someone fired.  Well fired or moved, just out of her current position.  I&apos;m going to be all cryptic because well its a work in process.  But its a brand new experience for me.  This person is someone of authority - in a position that should be respected, and yet has lost that.  I&apos;m not alone.  There is a large group of people who feel the same way as I do.  

So far I&apos;ve attended 2 meetings, and written a letter.  Now I&apos;m trying to figure out how to encourage others to be heard as well.  I&apos;ll tell you what though - if nothing happens then I will stop being cryptic and start yelling it at anyone who will listen.  This person does not deserve to be in this position in such a great place, with such wonderful people.
