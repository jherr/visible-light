I just ordered 2 replacement remotes for our satellite system.  Because for some reason they are tasty to LIttle Guy.  On the one from the bedroom he chewed off the protective plate that protects the light-bulbs that blink at the tv when I push buttons, and on the one in the living room he&apos;s chewed off several buttons including the one that turns on the sound system.  I love him but sometimes I want to boot him.

The other tech fun is Jack bought me a  [ Dru&apos;s ](http://www.xxeo.com/) Prius&apos;s GPS.  Now I have a little box in my car that tells me where to go - I downloaded a sexy Australian man&apos;s voice.  Now I just need a name... maybe Mr Darcy.  *sigh!*
