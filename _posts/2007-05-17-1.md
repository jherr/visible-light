Megan is napping.  She hasn&apos;t napped in 2 years!.  She was falling asleep on the way to cooking class and then again on the way home.  When I suggested she nap she refused so I bribed her with the library story time tonight and so she laid down and when I checked on her she was out.  

I think she has what ever bug i had yesterday, and today I feel great so hopefully she&apos;ll be up for camping tomorrow.  If not though we&apos;ll cancel and do it some other weekend.
