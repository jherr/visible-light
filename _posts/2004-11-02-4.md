Megan and I drove around today and looked at the long lines we were missing at the polls, thanks to early voting.  After we headed to the supermarket and while getting off the freeway a rock hit the windshield.   I was annoyed... mostly because the wonderful mood of seeing so many people VOTING!  its feels like a new day.

Well I just called the auto glass people and they are coming out in 45 mins.  Usually it takes days so now my good mood has returned.  

Oh yeah -- sorry Jack - it is your car after all :)

UPDATE: All fixed.  The nice young man arrived and fixed the chip in about 20 mins while I cleaned out the big freeze in the garage and we chatted about the election.  One note - the darn freezer has a wire bottom shelf that won&apos;t come out so while I could clean up most of the melted grape popsicle juice from great melt down of 2004, I couldn&apos;t get it all.
