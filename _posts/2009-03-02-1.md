Ah Monday.  I welcome its return but have to say this weekend will be missed.  Jack and I had a date night Saturday and Megan went for a night at Josephine&apos;s house.  It as her birthday party day so we went first to the party and had great food with great people.  After we left El Cerrito, we headed south to Berkeley and had an amazing dinner at  [Berkeley Repertory theater](https://www.berkeleyrep.org/)  and enjoyed the play <i/> In the Next Room (or the Vibrator Play).   What a hoot.  Well the first act anyway - the second act got all serious but was still very entertaining.  Jack wondered why I keep picking plays with full male nudity, but what can I say ... I just know how to pick &apos;em.   And now I know the cure for hysteria!

Sunday dawn, with us sleeping in.  Enjoying CBS new sunday morning with coffee in bed and heading out to do a little shopping.  We had lunch at a  [new brewpub](http://www.bjsbrewhouse.com/)  that just opened locally.  Great food, good beer, really really bad location.   After we got home, Jack worked out, I played around with the guitar on rock band, and then we both managed a little nap.   Pam and Yvonne brought back Megan, and we all had an afternoon of rockband and good food.  As Megan and I cuddled in her bed for the night we talked about her great weekend, and it was just such a perfect moment.  I love being a mom.
