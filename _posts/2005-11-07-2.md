I just got off the phone with my doctor&apos;s business office.  I got a bill from them that said they had done an extra part of a procedure I knew they hadn&apos;t done.   She says to me, &quot;well we already bill your insurance - what do you want me to do about it&quot;.  

&quot;Correct it&quot; I said, 

&quot;I suppose I could, but they haven&apos;t paid anything yet...&quot;

&quot;I know but you do realize the bill is wrong you didn&apos;t do that.&quot;

&quot;yeah but they haven&apos;t paid anything so well what do you want me to do? &quot;

&quot;CORRECT IT&quot;

&quot;are you sure?&quot;

&quot;yes&quot;

&quot;ok then if your sure, I&apos;ll submit a corrected claim&quot;

&quot;thank you...&quot; - a tad sarcastic to be sure

In the same mail but not opened until after the phone call was my insurance benefits explanation, they  had paid the claim.  What do you bet they don&apos;t send me a Thank you card for catching it.

Also I keep having doctors want to collect a 25 co-pay when My card says its $15.  Well the benefits form confirms its $25, so I keep ripping off my doctors.
