I just got a letter and a pin from the  [American Red Cross ](http://www.redcross.org/) - apparently I&apos;m officially a gallon donor - didn&apos;t know it was coming but I guess it makes since.

I&apos;ve been donating off and on since my mom died - in her honor at first and then just cause they won&apos;t leave me and my A- blood alone, but really it makes me some how feel closer to her.  Really when you consider that&apos;s only 8 pints and she died in 99 - its really taken me a while, but time off for having Megan and nursing and the whole anemic vegetarian thing I guess i&apos;m amazed I&apos;ve done a gallon.

I&apos;m schedule to donate on friday after I swim in the morning.
