We&apos;ve left the mice in California with our favorite  [sitter](http://www.livejournal.com/users/jeanetta_lucier/)  and the dogs and have headed to South Carolina to visit Jack&apos;s Mom and Step Dad.  Megan is having the time of her life, playing with cat and today while Jack and his mom shot a round of golf, Carlos, Megan and I went out on the party boat.  It was a glorious fall day, cool and sunny.  From the boat we saw fall colors and Megan and Pop&apos;s drove the boat for a while together and really bonded.

The trip here was long - a 5 hour flight to DC then a 1 hour layover ended up being a 3 hour layover, when we finally were allowed to board we were left to sit on the plane for 30 minutes and then were told our flight was canceled.  Luckily we were in the second row and made it to the customer service counter first, so we were rebooked on a later flight after the storm passed - but it meant we had another 3 hours in a rather dull airport.  So we got in at 11, and drove up to  [Keowee Key](http://www.keowee-key.com/)  by midnight.  A long day that started at 4am Pacific (7am Eastern).  Megan was a real trooper the whole way and when we boarded our second plane out of DC, Megan was the only one not complaining.  She was just happy to finally goto Grandma&apos;s and see the cat!.
