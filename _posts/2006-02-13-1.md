I got it into my head to make lollipops with Megan today so she could give them out to her class mates.  Last week I bought the forms, and sticks, and all the ingredients, for a  [ cherry lollipop recipe ](http://www.foodreference.com/html/cherrylollipopsr.html) I found on line.  I realized after burning my own fingers, that a 3 year old shouldn&apos;t be around boiling sugar, so I let her watch from afar.  I got the stuff in the molds with sticks and now its all cooling. 

I have to say though - not as gratifying to make as I thought.  Cool but really not that cool.  I&apos;ll update later when I pop the mold and let you know if they came out.  It does taste great - drops while filling the molds cooled quickly and allowed me and Megan to try it out.
