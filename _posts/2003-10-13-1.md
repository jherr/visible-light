Ripley&apos;s heart has broken.  Last night she was sure Jack would be coming home any minute so even though she came to bed with me she was quick to jump up and run to the front of the house for any noise.  Tonight, while Megan was in the bath she went to bed, and she hasn&apos;t moved since.  I&apos;m now in bed, and she is sighing heavily and often.  Poor girl is depressed that Daddy has left her to me and Megan.
