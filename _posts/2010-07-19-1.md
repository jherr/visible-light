For Jack&apos;s birthday on sunday I gave him 2 nerf guns...  and then we went to the park  to try them out, however a troop of 8 kids were lying in wait.  He had an idea that we wouldn&apos;t be playing alone - but he had no idea how many kids were coming.  Joe  a good friend of ours join us and was Jack&apos;s team mate against the kids.  He brought the heavy &quot;Vulcan&quot; nerf guns and somehow evened the odds.

Apparently the kids had been planning the attack for the previous 2 weeks - scooping out the terrain, measuring shot distances and coming up with cunning plans of attack.

The kids and Jack and Joe had an absolute blast.  The parents hung out too and we all had cake and snacks.  We all spent time walking around picking up used ammo so everyone could reload and start all over. 

I really want to thank all the kids who helped with the surprise, the parents who agreed to it, and Joe and E for coming to play as well.

I&apos;ll put the pics up on  [the shutterfly site - because there are just too many good ones - enjoy.](http://muttmansion.shutterfly.com) ..<br />
