Megan had a great morning.  When she first spied her booty from Santa her eye&apos;s went wide open and her jaw dropped.  She loved playing with all the new neat toys.  

Aside from a really bad movie I gave Jack (Alien Visitor) and a mediocre CD from Cindy Lauper (At Last), I think Jack had a pretty good Christmas.  

I got a great stuff too including some great Hawaiian CD&apos;s by an artist IZ. I&apos;ve made Jack and Megan listen to it all day.  We had a wonderful dinner of Calzone and Salad, followed by Strawberry Cheese cake.
