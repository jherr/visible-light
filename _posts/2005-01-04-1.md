Megan and I have been busy this morning organizing and straightening the kitchen/dinning room (where the new desk is). I moved my cedar chest back to my closet.  There just isn&apos;t enough room in the house for everything we want to do.  But bigger houses cost more money and so we&apos;re staying put.  

We also did our weekly pilgrimage to the supermarket.  Megan said 
&quot;cookie&quot; as we pulled into the parking lot, so our first stop was the bakery.  We saw  [Paddy](http://www.paddyscoffee.com/)  while we were there.  Now we&apos;re home putting it all away before lunch and a walk, since the weather is nicer than usual.  The back is still to soggy to actually go out and play so a walk around the neighborhood with Megan&apos;s &quot;Bi-cycle&quot; (tricycle) is in order.  

After that naps for both of us.  I&apos;ve got a touch of a cold, and Megan needs to get back on her sleep schedule.
