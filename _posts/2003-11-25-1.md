Every year the woman in my family do an ornament exchange for Christmas.  I usually buy an ornament, but a couple of years ago I took a beading class and made a couple of nice ornaments so I gave those to the woman I spent  the holiday with and the rest got store bought ones.  Well something possessed me and this year I decided to bead the whole lot and the one I need for an ornament exchange with some friends, so picture me in my free time (like I have so much of that with a toddler underfoot) beading on wire with itchy hands to boot.  Actually I&apos;m enjoying sinking my teeth into something - so to speak and have managed to make 3 of the 7 I need.
