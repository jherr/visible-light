Loving the weather-  we went to the pumpkin patch today and now the house is decorated with pumpkins and cobwebs.  We also tilted the paintings around the house.  

We had a great weekend hanging with friends.  Watching 2 movies while the kids played and watched movies and slept.

We&apos;re also working on Megan&apos; b-day plans.  She is having her party at our local indoor pool. I&apos;m also working on her costume - this week I shall be cutting out all the pieces.  

And that&apos;s about all our update.
