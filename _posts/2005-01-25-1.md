Well I went back to the Dr yesterday, had another breathing treatment and this time she gave me another inhaler, a shot of steroid (in the butt!) and a prescription for the steroid for the rest of the week.  I&apos;m still coughing but its definitely better- some how calmer.  She called it &quot;Bronchitis induced Asthma&quot; what ever that means.   I guess the respiratory infection has given my something akin to Asthma.  - oh joy.  If I&apos;m not better by friday she wants be back in early morning for a full work-up.
