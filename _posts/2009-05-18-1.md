UPDATE:  [More News coverage but still no ID](http://www.insidebayarea.com/top-stories/ci_12397331) 

Driving home over the dumbarton bridge today after lunch I saw a woman commit suicide. She was wearing a black dress, hat and shoes and she was so young and beautiful, and before 911 answered my call she jumped.    [Its already made the local news](http://www.insidebayarea.com/localnews/ci_12397331) .  The 911 operator did confirm to me that she had jumped, and I had to pull over again and have a cry.

I drove the rest of the way home in tears and  texted  Jack once I got home.  I had 30 minutes to pick up Megan and couldn&apos;t stop crying.  But talking to him helped.  Some cold water and sunglasses and I managed to smile as I approached the other moms to pick up our kids.  I gave Megan a big hug and we came home and played candy land, she read me smelly bear, and we watched some Little People Big World, but I am on the verge of tears if I just think about her - just for a second. I would hate her for ruining my day if I didn&apos;t feel so sorry for her for thinking there was no hope.  I just can&apos;t imagine ever feeling such disappear.  My heart goes out to her family.  And I&apos;m grateful for mine and all my friends who showed me support today on facebook.
