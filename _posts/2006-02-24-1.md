I got a junk email this morning from a &quot;Lloyd Bayon&quot;  I actually took a second look cause it reminded me of my favorite teacher, probably the one who first sparked my interest in history  - Lloyd Ballard, at Glades Junior High.  

Well it prompted me to do a google search for him, and he is now teaching at Miami High, and was  [interviewed on News Hour](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/education/jan-june03/fl_06-03.html)  back in 03.  It was great to get to see him on the video feed.  He really had a passion for teaching that not only inspired me to study history, but tempted me to think about maybe teaching someday.  He was definitely a favorite teacher of mine from all of school and my favorite from Glades.  Thank you Mr Ballard!
