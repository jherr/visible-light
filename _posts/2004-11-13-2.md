last day drive was long and we are all glad to be here.  The drive out of Portland along the river was beautiful.  But that ends and then its mundane farm land.  Its cold here so we&apos;ll be in layers. Total drive time today was 6 hours including 2 gas stops, 2 rest stops, 1 park and lunch...

We found the worlds worst pizza but the nicest staff in Peadmont Oregon.  I won&apos;t say were cause I liked the folks... just don&apos;t eat the Pizza.

Sadie is elated to be here.  She won&apos;t sleep with me though - I think she is glad to be rid of me.  She&apos;s down sleeping by her self near the other dog.
