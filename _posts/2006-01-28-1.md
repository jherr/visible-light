I noticed Oso was in the bay window, well partially - he had his hind end on the sofa and his front was staring out the window, watching the world go by.  I followed suit... kneeling on the sofa and watching out ... I saw the bluebird couple that i noticed in the yard, busy, building a nest in our front bush, a Robin was busy too looking for something on the ground - looked like she was digging for worms, or insects, and finally a humming bird was making its rounds around the yard collecting nectar... and then for a moment - he came to the window and was less than a foot from my face, staring - at me or his own reflection and then... he was gone.

Life is so resilient and so amazing.
