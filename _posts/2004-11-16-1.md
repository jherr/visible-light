Have you seen the ad on TV of the guy complaining that there we just no good vacuums out there so he invented one himself? Well the Bolducs have that vacuum and its amazing.  I have never seen a vacuum suck better.  It worked on floors and rugs.  And there was no spewing forth dust at any point.  An amazing cleaning experience
