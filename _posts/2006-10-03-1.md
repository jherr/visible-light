Tonight I had my  [Mom&apos;s club ](http://www.funmothersclub.org) end of year appreciation dinner.  It was at Champion Teppanyaki in Fremont.  I was late RSVPing like I didn&apos;t do it right away but waited a few days so I ended up at the last seating at 8.  Which means I was starving when they finally seaated me at 8:30.  I met a really nice mom who has a daughter just alittle younger than Megan and loves to sew.  We chatted all night long and swapped numbers in the end.  

But what shocks me, absolutely suprises the hell out of me is that I volunteered! To be on the board! all Next year! - I&apos;m now the secretary for the FUN mother&apos;s club.
