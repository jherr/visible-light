Jack and I met Mel up in Marin for dinner and a little sunset watching.  We found a really lovely Thai restaurant, and then drove up  [Mt Tam](http://www.mttam.net/) .  Currently Saturn, Venus and Mercury are all setting right after the sun making for some spectacular viewings, of course this being San Francisco we watched the sun set into the fog as it came at us.  The temperature drop as the fog approached was incredible, but the views up on Mt Tam were breath taking and the &quot;sunset&quot; really didn&apos;t disappoint.  Being at fog level was in its own way a cool experience, and there were lots of dear and interesting flora.  I&apos;m sure I will see the planets again someday.  Jack took a few pics so watch his blog for them.
