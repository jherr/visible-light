Jack Megan and I are going to a wedding on saturday. I spent the afternoon looking  for a dress and went to 3 speciality stores and 2 departments stores.  Only one store actually carried dresses and they were for someone a few generations older than I feel.  I came away from the whole experience rather depressed.  Tonight after Megan goes to bed I&apos;ll do alittle time shopping in my own closet, which I should have done in the first place.  If all else fails then I&apos;ll try again tomorrow.
