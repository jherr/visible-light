Megan has been writing stories.  Her school has a program called writer&apos;s workshop that encourages kids to be writers, and Megan already puts pen to paper and sounds out words and writes.  Its amazing to see the progress she&apos;s made.  

My favorite part is the notes she likes to give me.  Or the ones she just does and leaves around the house like  &quot;Mom is Myn&quot;.

Every time I stumble on one, it reminds me of the dozens of cards my mom sent me over the years.  Cards I packed and stored all over my house.  Now when I need her or when I least expect it, I find a moment with mom.
