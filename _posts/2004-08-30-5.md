Our neighbor, an original owner, assures us we have a clean out to the sewage in the front yard.  The bad news is its not marked and its buried a foot down somewhere on the line, that while marked on the street, is not straight up the yard but bends up and under our front walk. So I&apos;ll be heading to the city offices in the coming days to try and get the blue prints our house and maybe luck out and have it marked.  

I took such a heavy nap today when Megan napped that now i&apos;m having a hard time settling down for sleep.  I thought I&apos;d read a bit but the book I&apos;m reading  [ Outlander](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0440212561/qid=1093931244/sr=ka-1/ref=pd_ka_1/104-2893259-3932722)   is alittle slow moving at the point I&apos;m at, but so far is good.  

Anyway I took a melatonin  to help me get back on schedule and now that its had alittle time to work, I&apos;m heading to bed.
