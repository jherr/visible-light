He&apos;s not named cause there is always a chance an owner might arrive but we are falling in love

Megan today asked me what my mother&apos;s name was ... Michele I said, and her middle name? Turner...

Finally she asked what was grandma&apos;s last name ... Cutherell... We got home and Megan called little man Cutherell.  She&apos;s been calling him that all afternoon.  Its very cute.
