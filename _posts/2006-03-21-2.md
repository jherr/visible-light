Literarily ... Jack&apos;s out of town and I had to get the trash out tonight - only I couldn&apos;t find the gate key anywhere. Not on the freezer where we always keep it, or any pockets of any pants Jack or I wore in the last week.  No where I could think of!  After about an hour of serious frantic searching (cause on top of that the lawn man is coming tomorrow too)  I found instead Jack big ass Metal cutters and with the help of the wall of the house I clipped the lock right off.  Of course now i&apos;ll find the key. 

Megan and I will head out after dinner and buy a new lock with lots of keys!
