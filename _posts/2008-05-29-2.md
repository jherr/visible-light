we&apos;re up to 8 total this morning - including the one on the bottom of the tent that fell when I moved them over - 3 more to go to have all the chrysalis&apos;s transform.

I&apos;ll take some pictures later and share when I get a chance.  I&apos;m off to help in Megan&apos;s classroom.

UPDATE:  We ended the day with 10 - But I can&apos;t find the one remaining chrysalis so I keep recounting thinking there are really 11.  I&apos;ll try again in the morning.
