Sadie is doing  great - better than great.  Her  neck is completely better.  I had her groomed on Friday last week and now with her short hair cut she&apos;s prancing and acting like a 2 year old.  Its great to see.  She&apos;s also seems to be settling in her age (finally!)  Tonight she&apos;s sleeping on the sofa while I&apos;m watching TV.  I always knew she&apos;d sleep on the sofa, but she usually gets down when someone comes in the room and she has never gotten up there while we&apos;ve had the TV on.  Its wonderful to see that she finally feels at home here.  After years of abuse before we got her, she really didn&apos;t trust that we wouldn&apos;t hurt her when we&apos;d find her up on  furniture.  She was the first dog i&apos;d ever seen have a panic attack.  But now she&apos;s sleeping on the sofa - with one leg up in the air, and I know that she is finally at home.
