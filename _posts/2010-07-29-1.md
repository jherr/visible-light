I love days like today - where I just get so much done!  I put away all the camping equipment, took both little dogs to the groomer for a quick nail trim (and another thing you don&apos;t want to know), I cleaned out my car, and I made chocolate Ice Cream, and I made butter.  I took Megan to swim lesson and then went to the store.  I made bbq sauce for the ribs we are having for dinner tonight.  

I also plan on doing a bit of gardening before taking Megan to yoga and driving a friend of hers to dance practice on our way home.  

Tonight we are watching Harry Potter 4 since Megan finished the book last night.

I love summer and I love today. 


the bbq sauce recipe I developed (by combining the best of several recipes) is:

BBQ SAUCE

2 tbsp. butter
1 can tomato sauce.
2 tbsp. vinegar
1 tsp. salt 
1/4 tsp. pepper
1/4 c. onion, finely grated
2 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
juice from one lemon lemon juice
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tsp. dry mustard powder

Melt butter. Saute onion until soft. Add remaining ingredients. Simmer for 20 minutes. Makes about 2 cups of BBQ sauce.
