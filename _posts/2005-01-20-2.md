To have a gag reflex so sensitive that if I cough to hard and too much I might throw up.  At least when I threw up while pregnant I had a  great purpose!

The best part was though Megan patting my leg as I puked in the kitchen sink saying &quot;mommy  OK?  Mommy coughing? OK?&quot;  She&apos;s been a trouper today since I feel so yucky.  I haven&apos;t wanted to do much but she&apos;s cuddled and watched a Nova Special on the Mars rovers and Shrek.  Tomorrow - Cough or not - we&apos;re going to the park.
