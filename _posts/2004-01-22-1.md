Now Jack has the bug.  Megan is finally feeling better after 4 days of puking.   I only had that for one day but the second stage is set in on both of us.  Jack started late last night and poor Ripley was so concerned she actually got off the bed and stuck her nose under the bath room door in sympathy.  Its a humdinger of a virus.
