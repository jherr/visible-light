This past tuesday night I went out with a couple of mom friends of mine.  We did dinner and then headed over to the local mega-plex to see a film.  We&apos;d planned on seeing  [Lucky number sleven](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lucky_number_slevin/)  instead.  Now my friend Kari doesn&apos;t care for dramas or violence so I was surprised she agreed to see this particular film.  She&apos;s the reason I usually see every comedy that comes out.  Anyway she was all for it until we approached to buy our tickets.  I was first in line so while I was getting my ticket she asked the gril from behind me if &quot;Sleven&quot; was a comedy or not.  I looked at the girl with big eyes and mouthed &quot;Please tell her YES&quot;  well the girl did one better and was so convincing that Kari&apos;s fears were laid to rest until the opening credits when 3 people are murdered and very violently too.

She watched the whole movie and in the end enjoyed it, but when I told her at the end that the reason the girl lied was I begged her too - I think she wanted to kill me.
