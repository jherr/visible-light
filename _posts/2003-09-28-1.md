Where else but a blog can I rant about a pet peeve.  Today&apos;s peeve is hand washing.  I can&apos;t tell you how many woman I&apos;ve seen just slightly wet their hands when the finish in a public rest room, or just skip the sinks all together.  As if water does anything but wet their hands.  Yesterday at the movies this woman made a big show of walking over and barely rinsing her hands then grabbing the handle of the door.- grrr.  USE SOAP ALREADY its there for you to use.  On NPR I heard a story about how few men wash there hands comparied to woman - which is down right scary.  OK OK - rant over
