I donated blood yesterday.  It was the first time since I was pregnant that  I could donate when they called me on monday, Since Megan is weaned.  It does make one feel good to do something so simple.    I started donating just after my mom died as sort of an tribute to her.  She had several transfusions while she was fighting her cancer and I wanted to say thanks somehow for those people helping her.  Before that I was too chicken to have a needle stuck in me.
