How do I convince an almost 3 year old its time to move out of the crib and into a big bed?  She has no desire to leave her bed.

I know that she will one day be ready and patients is all that is required on my part, but its astounding to me that she says no every time I ask her if she wants a bed like Josephine (a friend of hers) or Mommy.
