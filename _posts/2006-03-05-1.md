I do this thing, where I don&apos;t want change unless its my idea, so I say I hate something.  Did it with  [ Firefly ](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/) (convinced I&apos;d hate it cause it was a western).  Both shows I found I loved once they were out on DVD.    Tonight we finished off Firefly and then watched Serenity.  The story is so well told, so well crafted.  The sparing between the cast members is really enjoyable.  Man I wish i&apos;d jumped on this band wagon sooner.

I did it with  [Tivo](http://www.tivo.com)  too- Jack bought the first one and I wouldn&apos;t let him get more than a 1 month subscription - by the end of the week I wanted another one for the bedroom - with lifetime subscription.  

Bet I would have done it with Dyson, had I not seen it with my own eyes before we got it.

I do change my mind and admit when i&apos;m wrong - but I wish I didn&apos;t have to go through the negative time where I reject things out of hand.  I want to be more open to trying new things.

Being a mom has made me try - I recently found out that I love slides -  the big blow up ones like pump it up has - and I certainly wouldn&apos;t have bothered trying them, if Megan hadn&apos;t asked me to go down with her.  I was content to stand at the bottom and watch, mainly because I was sure I hated it.  Glad I was wrong.

This train of conscience confession is being written at midnight and i am almost asleep.
