Update on my walking - 

5K a day continued for week 2 - M-F I did it - and only one day I needed extra after the dog walks but it was a stormy morning and freezing cold.  Megan supplied the time to finish with a few goes around the park on her skate board.

Today - my day off - I felt like walking - I took out both dogs for 1.25 mile walks - it wasn&apos;t going to be so long but I just felt like going.  

After we biked to the farmers market.
