The other day, Megan and I were rushing to get out of the house to get to Gym on time.  As we got to the garage door I smelled the immediate need to clean a diaper so we headed back in and I put my wallet and cell phone and keys down on the kitchen table.  We changed the diaper, and then on the way to the door I grabbed my things. 

As I approached the door the phone started ringing.  &quot;Ring&quot;Megan I said &quot;lets get the phone!&quot;  Having no phone in the kitchen we headed to the living room. &quot;Ring&quot; No phone in charger &quot;damn&quot; i mumbled under breath &quot;ring&quot; and rushed back to the office for the other phone &quot;ring&quot; answering machine picks up... I grab phone.  &quot;Hello&quot;  hello I hear, Hello Hello I hear... it sounds like me saying hello to me.. what the heck?  and then I notice the cell in my hand, squashed under my wallet and in the hustle ... I&apos;d called myself!
