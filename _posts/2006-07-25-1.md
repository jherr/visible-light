South Carolina is beautiful.  I do love California, but after what seems like months on end of blue skys and sun, and really start craving a little green.  This area fills that void much like Florida does, when I go there for vacations. 

Today we went out on the boat and found  [Sharon&apos;s Cache](http://www.muttmansion.com/ds/archives/002922.html)  with Cousin&apos;s Cooper and Jack  leading the search.   After kids and I spent some time swimming and playing on the beach before we all piled back in the boat and headed to find a new spot for the cache (more to come on that front later).

We returned for lunch and then headed into to Seneca to visit [The Learning Safari and Toy store](http://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&client=safari&rls=en&q=learning+safari&near=Seneca,+SC&cid=0,0,2231193429305397719&ll=34.689406,-82.993946&spn=0,.02&iwstate1=form:to&sa=X&oi=local&ct=directions-to&iwloc=A)   This is a great store with lots of fun and educational toys.  Once the kids &quot;I wants&quot; grew to loud we all headed back to the condo&apos;s for naps.  

Tonight we are all hanging out, having burgers and visiting with Mr Mike ( a wonderful friend of Sharon and Carlos&apos;s)

Tomorrow I will attempt to get up very early and pick up Jack whose flight gets in at 5:30am in Atlanta. Its a 3 hour drive so I&apos;ll be leaving before dawn.  Wish I wasn&apos;t still on California time.
