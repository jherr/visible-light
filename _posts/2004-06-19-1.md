I booked flights for Megan and myself to SC and then onto Florida for July and Aug.  I was originally quoted a fare of 800 for both of us.  Our credit card bill came today and we were charged 2100.  When I called the airline they put me on hold for 20 mins then they agreed to give us a travel voucher for 1300.  They couldn&apos;t credit us back the money because &quot;they were non-refundable tickets&quot;

So were getting back the money but we have to travel with it in the next year and on the same airline!   I feel so duped, but I have nothing on paper just my word that the original price was 800.
