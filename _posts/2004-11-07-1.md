Megan, Sadie and I are planning a road trip soon.  Ok I&apos;m planning and they are going along for the ride.  I&apos;ve been looking at activities to burn off some energy of Megan and completely forgot I should do the same for Sadie.  

I&apos;m also realizing that such a big venture means I&apos;m going to sleep less and less as it approaches.  My mind is starting to race with list of things to pack, plans while on the road, etc etc etc.

In case your wondering, we&apos;re heading to Walla Walla to see the Bolducs.
