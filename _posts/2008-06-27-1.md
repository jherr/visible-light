Megan and I decided to head down to   [Great America](http://www.pgathrills.com/)  today by ourselves.  We had a great time.  Megan wore her sandals which gave her the needed boast to qualify for 48 inch rides.  So she got to ride on the big swings in the front and she and I braved a flying in circles ride while mommy&apos;s tummy flips.  We headed down at lunch so we grabbed a quick bite and then watched the show &quot;Endless Summer on Ice.&quot; We were pleasantly surprised to find one of Megan&apos;s Ice Skating instructors to be on the cast.  Megan has now added being in an ice skating show like Rebecca on her list of what she wants to do in the future!.

After we headed back to the front and around to the other side of the park where Megan enjoyed her favorite ice cream treat ...

Then we caught the last 15 mins of the Sing with Dora show where Megan immediately joined the group in front and danced the chicken dance with Dora...
