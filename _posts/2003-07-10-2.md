Ok I&apos;ll admit it, I watch those cheesy reality shows.  Amazing race is fun to watch people do crazy stuff,  Its like taking your family member and adding pressure, Last night I caught the new season of Big Brother which is the bottom of the barrel for me.  I&apos;m a sucker for the Osbournes though thanks to Tivo I tend to ignore any scene with the daughter Kelly or the son Jack.  I just like watching Ozzy bumble around.  I really liked the Mole but I seem to have been the only one cause its gone.  I do draw the line and don&apos;t watch fear factor cause of the gross factor, or any of the so called talent shows,  I also avoid the strange dating shows (though I did happen to catch a few episodes of last season&apos;s the bachelor, but he was a local boy I couldn&apos;t help it). 

I&apos;m wondering what the fall will have in store - there doesnt seem to be a limit to what the networks will do to people or rather have people do for money.    I&apos;m usually shocked by what  see on the shows now - I can&apos;t imagine them getting more outrageous but I&apos;m sure they will.
