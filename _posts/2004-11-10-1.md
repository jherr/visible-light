sometime later today picture me driving with Megan watching Nemo and Sadie in the back, all crammed in with stuff... lots of stuff.

I have alittle bit of packing left, but a Doctor&apos;s appointment this morning so we&apos;ll head out after that.  Our first stop will probably be Redding CA.   I doubt i&apos;ll have internet till i get to our destination so wish me well and I&apos;ll tell you all about it later.
