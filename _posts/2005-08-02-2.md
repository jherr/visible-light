Public works is doing something load to our street, I think they are putting in handicap access to the sidewalks or something like that, but the end result is hours of jack hammers just outside our house.  Megan refuses to play outside because of the noise.  She went out front with me to see what was up but came running back inside terrified at the sight of the bulldozers.  So now she&apos;s stuck with a sick mom and doesn&apos;t want to play outback, to top it off I think after our Shrek a thon of this morning she&apos;s actually sick of the tv.  One wonders if I&apos;ll actually be able to get a nap out of her after such a boring morning.  I know i&apos;m ready for one.
