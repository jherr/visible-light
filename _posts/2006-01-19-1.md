UPDATE: well the city called and Megan&apos;s Tumbling class was canceled do to lack of enrollment, so we&apos;re back to square one on gymnastics.  At least the cooking is a go.

I might have just over extended us, but i&apos;ve signed Megan up for a couple of classes.  So now she has Gymnastics on Monday, School on tuesday, Cooking on Wed, School on Thursday and play-group on friday!  I get the time she&apos;s at school and cooking to run errands.  which is 7 1/2 hours. 

She went to her first cooking class yesterday and loved it!.  they made apple sauce muffins and she told both me and Jack the recipe and how they mixed it all together.  Then while it cooked they had circle time and a story with songs and dancing and she told me she gets to go back! so i think we have a winner.
