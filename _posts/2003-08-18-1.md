So We&apos;ve been monitering the girls eating to try and figure out why Ripley&apos;s not really loosing weight (despite the mega low calorie food the vet has her on).  On Saturday while cooking dinner I noticed that Sadie leaves about 1/4 to 1/8 of her meal and refuses to go back to her bowl til its gone.  We made Ripley go in with Jack and I still couldn&apos;t get Sadie to eat it.  Once I dumped it out though she happily licked her bowl clean.  Next night Jack noticed the same thing ( I was at a movies.)  and Sadie left Ripley an offering.... So now we have to make sure Ripley never gets these offerings.  I&apos;m going to try and feed Sadie alittle less tonight and see if she still leaves some or forgets and just eats t all.  I&apos;m sure either Jack or myself will keep you posted.
