Megan and I head down to Disneyland to meet up with Mike, Missy and Justin.  Megan has a slight cold so we&apos;re hoping for health by then.  She has grown so much I bought the next size up of Diapers today.  I&apos;ll be apple free for this week so I probably won&apos;t be blogging again until next week.  

I did see a movie on the weekend - Matchstick Men- pretty good - Nicolas Cage is an amazing actor.  Jack and I also watched Carnivale a new show by HBO that I must say is just plain weird.  It is well made and has great acting - so it might be worth something.  We shall see.
