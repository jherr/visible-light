Sourdough starter finally getting really sour - and the bread has a definite hint of it.  Have been making it once a week to keep starter going.  This past Sunday I made 2 loaves and Megan wanted it for her lunches so it was sliced and frozen.  

I also made my first from scratch Pumpkin pie (Martha Stewart&apos;s Recipe) it included Molasses and Honey.  The hardest part was cutting up the pumpkin - butcher knife got stuck - but once I got it out and cut up, it steamed nicely, pureed nicely and the pie was delicious - and I have never been a fan of Pumpkin pie.  I think now its because it has always tasted tinny to me.  I bought 3 more sweet pumpkins and will be doing  pumpkin bread when I get a chance.

We also had the best Pizza we&apos;ve ever made about a week ago - it included a jar of my canned tomatoes and the crust was simply wonderful - I noticed that none of us had crusts left on our plate.
