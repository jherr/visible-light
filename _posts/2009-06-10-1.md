Tomorrow is the last day of first grade.  My girl is growing up way to fast! 

We leave for our vacation on Saturday - 8 days in Arizona.  Before that, Megan and I are going to celebrate her success and get pedicures on friday!.

I know this summer is going to fly by but I&apos;m planning on really enjoying it and living in the moment!
