The supreme court is hearing arguments today on the pledge of allegiance and the phrase &quot;One Nation Under God&quot;  I for one hope they find for the atheists and polytheists in our country who don&apos;t believe in one god and are denied the right to a simple patriotic act by their own feelings and beliefs.   We should be allowed to be patriotic first and foremost.  This is our country, whether your Christian, Jew, Buddhist, Taoist, Hindu,  Agnostic or Atheist.  We are above all else Americans. 

The words &quot;One Nation under God&quot; were not part of the original pledge and were added in 1954.  I&apos;m surprised it took 50 years for this to come to the supreme court.  We are a nation of immigrants of all faiths from all other nations who originally came here and started this country to rid our selves of Religious persecution, yet Americans are persecuted every day for not being apart of the Christian majority.  The Supreme Court  was good enough to hear this case, now we can only hope the get it right.
