My best oscar picking ever.  Jack and I tied so what ever we were betting for we get to split.  Also means it doesn&apos;t matter that I saw all those films since Jack only saw a few.

I had a fun night at a  friends house and met some really nice people.  Jack hung out at home with Megan and I thought he was going to have company but they bailed.  But I think he was happy to have some time alone once Megan when down.
