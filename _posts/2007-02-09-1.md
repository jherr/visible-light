I set out today to swim 2 miles.  After doing it monday and having it kick my butt I figured I&apos;d not do it again, but then I spent the last few days thinking about it - wanting it and so today I did it ! 

How strange that just a few months ago - last sept/Oct I was worried that I wouldn&apos;t be able to even swim 1 mile in time for the swim-a-thon - let alone 2 miles in one sitting.
