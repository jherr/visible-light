This weekend I saw one of the  [ Oscar](http://www.oscars.com/nominees/nomineelist.html)  contenders from my list &quot;In America&quot;.  It was an excellent film.  Djimon Hounsou  is nominated for supporting actor and Samantha Morton is nominated for lead actress.  It is also nominated for WRITING (ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY).  I don&apos;t think it stands a chance in any of the 3 categories.  Tim Robbins was outstanding in Mystic River for supporting actor.  Charlize Theron has my vote for her role in Monster, and I&apos;m betting on Lost in Translation to win for writing.  I still have quiet a few to see but the timing is hard.  Today I wanted to be back in time for the super-bowl commercials so I went to Win a date with Tad Hamilton which was in no way worth it.
