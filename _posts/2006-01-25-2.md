We love Sadie.  Megan loves Sadie.  She&apos;s been a great and faithful dog.  I&apos;ve spent a fortune on her just on medicine... on  [Viokase Powder](http://discountpetdrugs.com/vipo12oz.html)  which we go through at least a bottle a month, On insulin, testing strips, needles, etc.  She&apos;s a very expensive dog.  Now the vet has us cooking chicken breast for her - and to make it easier on myself, i&apos;ve been buy big bags of frozen boneless, and skinless breast, baking it 6 at a time and then chopping it up and putting it in portion size ziplocs.  

So how does this dog repay me all my hard work.  While at Costco today buying her meds and chicken she peed on the kitchen rug.  Not on the easily cleaned floor but on the damn rug!  I just spent 20 minutes on the floor of the garage steam cleaning the rug and cursing the dog.  

I do love her but some times...
