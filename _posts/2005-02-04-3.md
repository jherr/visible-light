My new favorite beverage is a  [Moscow Mule](http://www.webtender.com/db/drink/1348) .  Basically I use a whole ginger beer with a 2 oz shot of Vodka. I also haven&apos;t added the lime juice yet - too lazy, and I haven&apos;t ordered it out yet, I don&apos;t often have the opportunity.  - I stumbled across it while trying to figure out what to make with ingredients on hand.  A few years back I gave Jack a set of bar cards, and every once and a while I search through them to find a tasty new libation.
