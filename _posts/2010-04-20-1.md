We got up a bit slower today.  Headed down to eat and then back up to our room to packup and check out.  We checked out the Pioneer Adventure Center which must be really cool in the summer but was a tad boring in the winter nice walk around though.   Then we did a hike near the hotel   = Meadow Loop which proved to be the old stage road.

We then headed south out of Yosemite (toward Fresno).  We turned west and then north before heading west and then south.  Finally arriving at Pacific Grove a bit after 3.  We found our B&B and then took a walk along Ocean drive.

We ate a great dinner at Peppers CafÃ©, walked back to the hotel and then drove over to the west where we watched the sun set.  I really must post some pictures.

It was a quiet day ending with Megan in the tub relaxing and me surfing for the first time in a week.  Love being connected again.
