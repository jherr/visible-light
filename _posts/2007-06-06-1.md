As i was leaving Starbucks last night with my decaf mocha in hand on the way to a lecture on wills and trust put on my mothers club,  I over heard 2 girls talking to each other about a poster on the door.  A poster of  [Paul McCartney](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/318651_starbucks06.html)   one said to the other who the heck is that, and the the other replied she had no idea.  At which time a store employee said  you know the guy from the Beatles, and both girls looked at him blankly and replied who are they??????!
