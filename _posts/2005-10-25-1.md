Jack and I went up to Sacramento once when we first moved here.  I was not really impressed, considered it a backwater and overall thought it was very industrial.  My opinion was not improved the 2 times I drove up, to visit the great dane &quot;Roscoe&quot; to consider adopting him.  

Imagine my surprise when on NPR (I think Talk of the Nation but I can&apos;t verify that) I hear that Sacramento is the most treed city in the US, and it started back in the 1800&apos;s when they decided to be more like Paris.  I will have to visit again sometime and this time pay attention.
