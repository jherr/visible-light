I&apos;m at the point of the trip when I want to be home already.  You know that -I just want my own bed, etc feeling.  I&apos;m having fun, but I&apos;m sure the Bolducs would love for us to get out of their hair.  We&apos;re delayed because of Sadie.  After her no-blood sugar attack last week, the vet said that I should bring her back just before we take off for a recheck.  Great idea for the drive but it means instead of leaving wed, as planned we&apos;re probably leaving sunday instead.
