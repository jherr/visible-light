A  [local car dealer](http://www.davidmaustoyota.com/index.asp)  here in northern Florida can&apos;t even pronounce the name of the cars he sells.  I couldn&apos;t even replicate how he mutilates toyota, but its a hoot.

On a side note - why oh why do they have to raise the level of the sound when you goto commercial.  I know it was so we could hear the commercials even when we left the room, but in todays day of Tivo and Mute buttons - what&apos;s the point except to annoy us.
