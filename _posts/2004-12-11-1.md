Megan and I enjoyed a morning in the park with our playgroup.  At one point she disappeared into the public bathroom with one of her playgroup friends Scottie.  When I found them they were busy splashing each other in one of the stalls! They were both wet from head to toe.  I escorted them both out and went to find Scottie&apos;s mom, all the while saying - yucky, ugh, gross.
