We arrived in Arizona today.  We first flew through Phoenix and then took a propeller plane to Flagstaff.  It was a really really really bump ride up to Flagstaff and I had to hold on to my arm rest and my lunch.  But we made it and got the rental car with no issues.  We headed back south 20 miles to Sedona - driving through some really pretty country.  Simply Gorgeous!

We found our hotel, had a swim and then Jack and I took Megan out for a great dinner to celebrate our 17th Anniversary - at  [Sacvannah&apos;s](http://www.savannahs.net/) .  By the time we got back the cousins had arrived and they all swam while the adults watched and hung out at the pool.  Off to bed - I hear tell of a hike in the morning, and tomorrow evening we are breaking away from the group to go enjoy the night sky with the guidance of an astronomer.
