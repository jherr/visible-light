Tonight we saw  [The Golden Compass](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/his_dark_materials_the_golden_compass/) .  I was thoroughly entertained.  I look forward to sequels if they get the funding. I don&apos;t get the ruckus by the right - honestly it was that ruckus that made me want to see it.  Long story short - very entertaining ride, if you like sci-fi/fantasy at all.  I felt it held up to LOTRs and it was much more interesting and engaging a story than Narnia. 

I shouldn&apos;t have any trouble sleeping unless the movie from last night creeps back each times I close my eyes.
