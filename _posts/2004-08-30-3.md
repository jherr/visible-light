Supervisor found the roof vent so they now have &quot;the MACHINE&quot; out back are running it up.... the racket isn&apos;t nearly as bad as when the lone guy was trying the toilets.  Supervisor is going to try and figure out where the line runs in the front, and how deep since we really need an access out there.  Figures installing an access will run 500-700 bucks.  

I&apos;m wasting fast, and the toilets still need to be re-installed.  Looks like an all nighter.
