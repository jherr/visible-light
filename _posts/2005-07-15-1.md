The last couple days Megan has really been testing me and her own boundaries.  Basically what ever I ask her to do like put on her shoes she refuses and waits to see what I&apos;ll do ....

so now this morning she has been sitting in a small chair in the kitchen with out making a sound for over 10 minutes.  I told her she could get up only after she apologies and does the task I put to her.  

We were off to a bad start this morning anyway because she didn&apos;t sleep well with out her blanket (not to Aunt Robin, Next time make 2 identical blankets so that when one needs to be washed the other back up is there!)  Last night after she&apos;d gone to bed she proceeded to remove all her pj&apos;s and put them on her big stuffed purple bear.  Then her little ty green bear got wrapped in a pee soaked diaper.  Then she stark naked peed in her bed and managed to soak her pillow as well as her blanket.  

She is a sweet kid and I love her dearly but this week has been a heck of a test. 

UPDATE - she lasted 12 minutes - I got a hug an I&apos;m sorry mommy and her shoes are now on and she&apos;s ready to go
