 [ The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/ref/movies/1000best.html)  1000 best movies list is out.  The pretentious lot have missed some great flicks.  Of the 1000 listed I&apos;ve seen 216 (maybe a handful more - I just don&apos;t remember).  This is what I did this evening, while watching the bad Ellen Barkin movie &quot;Mercy.&quot;
