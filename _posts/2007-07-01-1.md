While in the dressing room at Macy&apos;s I overheard the a conversation of a woman trying on clothes with her sister, her sister&apos;s toddler in a stroller not happy to be there and her husband on the phone.  

Well first she had her niece talk to her husband and say &quot;Auntie Ellen needs the Coach&quot; For those of you who don&apos;t now or don&apos;t watch Sex and the City - Coach is a brand of hand bag.  

After getting the toddler to babble on the phone long enough to piss anybody off, she took the phone and he apparently said &quot;no&quot;... So she started pleading.  First it was &quot;It&apos;ll be my graduation present&quot;  The it was &quot;it&apos;ll be for all that work I do for your company, the bills, the accounting&quot;  Still no.


Then she pulled out all the stops ... &quot;H_o_n_e_y&quot;  You can just hear the sick sweetness can&apos;t you...&quot;I&apos;ll give you a blow Job!&quot;  At this he actually stopped and asked how much the purse was and she said &quot;only two... Hundred ... and Fifty....DOLLARS!&quot;  Giddy now because she thinks she&apos;s won... and he said 

&quot;NO!&quot;

After I left I waited a few minutes out front to see them come out, I just had to see the woman who admitted to all to hear that she was a glorified hooker - is $250 really the going rate?
