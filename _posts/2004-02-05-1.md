Jack makes it looks so easy.  Posting pictures keeping the world updated on Megan... but it must be alot more complicated cause my brother hasn&apos;t shared but one picture of his new daughter!  More Pictures Please.

Update:  OK My brother is given a reprieve.  Little Elizabeth had to spend an extra day in the hospital, so I&apos;m giving him a break and guessing he&apos;ll have new pictures up this weekend.
