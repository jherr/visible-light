I took a 4 hour class today on pet first aid and CPR.  It was a refresher for the infant class we took before Megan was born, with a few notable differences. I feel better prepared for my dogs ailments having now taken it.  Nothing I learned could have helped with  [Oso ](http://www.muttmansion.com/wiki.cgi?OsoPage) and all future dogs will have a prepared care giver.  I guess my main reason I took the class was guilt and anguish over loosing Ripley.  Always wondering if I could have done more, or at least made her more comfortable.  

So now I know how to Muzzle a dog ( and how to improvise the muzzle), perform rescue breathing, CPR, check for pulse, bandage, deal with poisoning, snake bites, stings, fractures etc.  I know how to check for anemia, Over heating, and what to do with frost bite, and shock.  

When I got home Oso was kind enough to allow me to muzzle, to show Jack my new skill, and to allow me to practice locating a pulse. 

It was such an informative class, and I thank the  [The Animal Nanny](http://www.theanimalnanny.com/)  for inviting me.
