I picked up Sadie&apos;s ashes yesterday.  It was something i&apos;d been putting off for over a week.  I just didn&apos;t want to go back to the vets office, but now some how i feel more at peace and wish I&apos;d done it last week. She was a dog that got the short end of many sticks.  Her first owners abused and then abandoned her, she had more illness than any being should have to endure.  And she never really latched on to us until we had Megan and then she was all about protecting Megan and loving Megan until she went blind.  

Our previous dogs that died we were given a ceramic paw print and the ashes.  And for Sadie they didn&apos;t do the paw print.  When I asked where it was they said You should have ordered it.  Well I said I would have had you asked, but this is my 3rd dog and the last 2 it just came with. ... too late now - gotta let it go.  I do have her paw print in the veggie garden, from when we put the path out there.  We put down everyones print including Megan who was just a few months old.
