This guy was persistant!  He is in Ocala and was on the street corners near my dad almost daily - that is until I wanted to get a better picture of him and started making sure I had the better camera.  

No matter this one turned out ok - His sign just cracked me up for its english

My dad says he was for Clinton which makes his new sign really funny - seeing as Clinton and Obama are from the same party.
