Ok go  [ here and read the story (scroll down a couple of days to March 23.)](http://www.woostercollective.com/) - of the artist who hung his own art into the Moma and 3 other museums and it hung there for 3 days before someone noticed.  He had pictures taken of him doing it! What a riot - I wonder how many people saw his art and talked about it seriously.
