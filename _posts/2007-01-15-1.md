I made a new masthead last night because Duncan is such a part of our lives and he wasn&apos;t on my old one - I probably won&apos;t change it monthly like  [Amanda at Very Zen](http://www.amanda.veryzen.com/)  but once a quarter is a good goal - enough to reflect the changes in our life.    The middle picture where Megan is up on my shoulders was at Disney.  I ordered a bunch of prints last night from shutterfly from our trip and I plan on getting back into scrap booking - I haven&apos;t scrapbook since Megan&apos;s 2nd b-day which means i have 2 years to catch up on.  

The swim is going well.  Jack and I split the weekend - he swam on Saturday and I got sunday - since the lap pool is only open for a few hours in the morning on those days.  I don&apos;t get to swim today cause its a holiday and they have weekend hours, and Megan is home, instead i&apos;ll do this exercise video since its too cold to use the elliptical in the garage - I&apos;ll admit it I&apos;m a wus :) 

We had a really lovely weekend.  Saturday was just quiet -After Jack swam, I got a hair cut while Jack and Megan went up to  [Star Struck&apos;s](http://www.starstrucktheatre.org/)  production of Peter Pan!.  Megan loved it and the production value was really good.  The enormous cast  of kids did a really wonderful job.  There was one adult  - The man who played hook and he was particularly good.  

Megan and I have a quiet day planned - she is out of school for the holiday so we are going to meet a friend and go see Charlotte&apos;s web.  After lunch we plan on running the kids around the park - despite the cold.  Probably the park across from  [Paddy&apos;s](http://www.paddyscoffee.com/)  so the mom&apos;s can have hot beverages to keep us warm.  Reminds me I need to go throw my Jacket and scarf in the dryer or i&apos;ll be freezing my ass of this morning.
