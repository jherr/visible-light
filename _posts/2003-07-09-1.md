There was a brush fire in Brisbane CA which is south of San Fransisco near the SF airport.  The sea breeze was such that I smelled the smoke, and went out side to see if one of my neighbors had set their homes on fire.  The sky was an orange haze, the smoke was thick enough to burn my eyes and when Megan sneezed I closed our windows.  I called Jack to see what he was up to for dinner and he had no idea the fire was even happening.  He was down in Redwood City on the Penisula side of the bay just 15 mins away from the fire.  Here I was accross the bay at least an hour by car and we were having the orange/brown tinted sunset.  Amazing how this area is.
