Jacqueline asked in comments on a previous blog about my astronomy interest and since my reply was turning into a regular blog entry I decided to go ahead and move it. Beside I know of a couple of readers who avoid reading comments.

Astronomy has always been an interest.  Jack gave me a very small telescope for Christmas right after we moved here, but with no tracking motor and such small optics, I enjoyed spying on neighbors more than star gazing.  Then a few years back I took a class at the local collage and was hooked. For my 30th Jack gave me a  [Moon Shots](http://www.muttmansion.com/wiki.cgi?AstronomyPics) .  Basically I&apos;ve seen rings on saturn, the spot on Jupiter, topography on Mars, a few galaxy and nebula, and lots of empty space in between.  Most visitor&apos;s are more impressed with Saturn than anything else, but I have to say I was most blown away with seeing the storm on jupiter.  This is all from our very light polluted back yard.  Jack and I have been discussing taking it out to the middle of no where, but we haven&apos;t gotten around to it yet.

I am really looking forward to taking Megan out and showing her the universe, when she&apos;s older.  Already she knows about Moon and stars and loves to go out and have me point them out to her.
