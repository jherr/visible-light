Megan is sick - she&apos;s stuffed up and coughing so no school today.  No swimming today either for me.  But I will be taking my laptop back to apple.  When they fixed it the last time I think they left a wire loose cause I loose my monitor sometimes. - Thank goodness its still under warranty.  I made a genius bar appointment for 11:20 am so we&apos;ll head over around 10:40 and then after have lunch at CPK. 

Then back home for more rest for Megan.

She&apos;s already informed me she&apos;ll be better by tomorrow.
