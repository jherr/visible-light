I enjoyed this  [ article ](http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?pt=vKO1twmWG2Uvnyi2qoWQfW%3D%3D)  more than I should have... but when your leader is constantly pushing that he is a religious man, and you find out that he doesn&apos;t actually attend church... you tend to wonder &quot;Did I hear that right? Surely not!&quot;  I know he&apos;s a busy man... I was listening at the first debate when he said it was hard work, but Clinton had the same job, managed to attend church regularly. So did Carter and he even taught Sunday Schoo.  I&apos;m sure Bush is spiritual and religious in his own way. Something smells alittle hypercritical.
