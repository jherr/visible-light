So on my journey my laptop started flaking out.  I was loosing the monitor and a good shake would bring it back and then it would go away again... it was frustrating.  But I was determined to fix it.  Until ... Jack arrived today with a brand new G4 Ibook.  It took less than one hour for my old machine to tell my new machine everything it needed.  And now I&apos;m all set to go.. even my picture of Megan transfered.  It has everything.

I love you honey - your so funny.
