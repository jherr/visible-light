I was having Safari trouble and my dad recommended that I reset Safari, I did without understanding the ramifications.  I lost all my fill in the blanks on forms so all my user names and passwords are gone, and I must remember them.  It means I couldn&apos;t blog until Jack refreshed my memory.  I&apos;m back now ;)
