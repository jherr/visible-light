I made it through my first 24 hours in the cast.  My sides hurt from the crutches, but I made myself goto Target today to get Megan&apos;s School Supplies and a game Jack wanted.  The cart was nice but it was my slowest trip there ever. 

My biggest issue is getting comfortable.  Last night despite a vicodin I couldn&apos;t sleep - I tossed and turned until I realized I needed gravity to keep the cast from sliding and putting pressure on me.  So I grabbed the crutches, headed to the closet and got my old Wedge pillow I used to combat heart burn in pregnancy.  I used it so it was sloped down toward the foot of bed with my knee at the highest point.  I couldn&apos;t sleep as I normally do on my stomach, but I did finally get comfortable enough to doze off and on until 6. I&apos;m sure sleep will get easier as the month wears on.


You guys are going to love this - a whole month where I have little to do but blog about being bored.
