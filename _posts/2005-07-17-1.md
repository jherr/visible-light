 [A great story of a US Soldier](http://www.armytimes.com/story.php?f=1-292925-976420.php)  who survived a sniper attack and then once the sniper was secured gave medical care to that sniper.  Our boys (and women) over there are doing a fantastic job.  They should be supported 100%.
 [Even when we disagree with the war,](http://www.commondreams.org/views04/1214-31.htm)  like alot of American&apos;s do with Iraq, our soldiers are out there and need to know the American people are behind you!

My thanks to  [my friend Heather](http://hstankowski.blogspot.com/)  for highlighting the great story.
