Its the third day of me biking and Mimi running and I declare it a success.  Today we went a mile, with her running full tilt all the way.    Monday we did a mile and half.  Though she was definitely dragging by the end then.  So her limit seems to be about a mile.  But that is pretty good for a dog that weighs in under 20 lbs.  And she sleeps great - though she still found energy to destroy my glasses.  <br />
