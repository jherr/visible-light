The one thing about getting a group together of like minded individuals is that the constant talk about Politics can get tiresome.  When my family gets together we tend to avoid any topic that might cause strife which means we basically talk about Poop, death and sex.  But Jack&apos;s side of the family, all agree politically so the conversation is dominated with Politics, more Politics and alittle Religion.  On the other  hand though it is great to have a room of people who agree with you and want to hear what you have to say.
