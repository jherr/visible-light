x rays taken, vicoden given, pain better.  will find out if its actually broken after radiologist looks at the pics, otherwise rest and ice prescribed.  Turns out also have swimmers ear - antibiotic for that and orders to not swim - will use ear plugs - must get in my miles.  though not today - no swimming for me today.
