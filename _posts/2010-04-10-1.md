April 6

We woke up just before 7 am.  Managed to get dressed and down to breakfast fairly quickly.  Driven I think by my need of coffee.  We headed back on the mountain road down to Yosemite Lodge to catch our 10 am tour of the valley.  

Not sure it was worth the price but Megan enjoyed hanging with other kids and it did give us a great starting point.  We saw 2 coyotes out hunting, and enjoyed the sights.  We ended the tour back at the lodge and walked down to Yosemite falls.  Finally catching a bus to The village.  The idea being we would go have lunch at the Big hotel Ahwahnee  Well they were doing construction on the road out to it so walking turned out to be much quicker of course we waited for 20 mins before I decided we should just walk.   We got there and the wait was 40 mins for the dining room so we opted for sandwiches at the bar not great but by the time we walked there we were starving.

They had straightened out the bus issues when we emerged from the hotel so we were able to bus back to the Visitor center.    There we got Megan started on the junior ranger program, and watched the movie and explored a museum.  We also found the art studio, which would be important tomorrow.  Back to the hotel for a quick dinner of Cup of Noodles, and a we both crashed from the day of walking.
