We had a really great time after riding the train and then after saying farewell to Tucker we headed over and got to feed the sheep, and goats.  The babies are very cute, they&apos;ve recently had 2 sets of triplets born to some sheep along with several others.  I took pictures of the cute babies but Jack who downloads the camera must not have been moved because they have disappeared.

We finished up watching in the blacksmith shop before heading back out.  We did find out when the sheep shearing would be and I hope to take Gee back for that and maybe a house tour since I think she can probably handle going through the house now.
