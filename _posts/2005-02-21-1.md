Last week Jack and I happened upon  [Project Runway](http://www.bravotv.com/Project_Runway/) .  We both watched in disbelief.  Could this really be a show or was it a joke...

After about 20 minutes i was hooked, and found Bravo&apos;s schedule a &quot;Thon&quot;, Set up the   [TIVO](http://www.tivo.com)  and then stayed up till 3 am watching all the episodes in a crazy haze.  I was so exhausted today a result of my sleepless night I napped when Megan napped, which means I probably won&apos;t be  able to sleeping tonight.
