This morning Jack was wonderful and took Megan with all her toys to his office so I could rest.  I managed to sleep until about 10:15 when Oso went ape shit in the back yard.  I yelled, and he ignored me.  I tried to go back to sleep and then Sadie joined him.  I finally yelled (and if you heard my lovely new tenor voice you&apos;d realize that was a stretch), and both dogs came in.  I took a shower and both dogs went back out to bark.  

By the time my shower was over though, they had calmed down.  So I thought nothing of it.  

Then this afternoon I headed to the doctor to get some help for this bug.  (Fever is still there, she suspects its viral but gave me a couple of things to aid in breathing and sleeping).  I headed home and there was a cop car out front.  Turns out our neighbors to the right (facing our house) were broken into...they suspect it happened around 10:30.  I told the neighbor about the dogs and he sent the cops over to talk with me.  

So Oso was correct and I should have noticed not that he was barking but what he was barking at.  I felt bad that I ignored him.   He&apos;s not usually one to bark in the back at nothing, though usually its just a squirrel.
