Yesterday, I took Megan to  [Sulpher Creek](http://www.hard.dst.ca.us/sc_programs.html)  park in Hayward, for the toddler time with the animals.  She got to touch a turkey, a chicken, a turtle , a hamster and a guinea pig.  She also got to feed a chicken a mill worm and watched the turtle eat flowers, the hamster stuff his poach with seeds, and feed the guinea pig dandelion leaves.  She had a blast. They also had an art project for the kids, and then we wondered the ground and saw a coyote, and lots of birds of prey on the mend.

After my friend suggested a  [Buffalo Bills](http://www.buffalobillsbrewery.com)  a local restaurant for lunch and it was really good.  Nice to find a really good one restaurant on our side of the bay.  What&apos;s more I bought 2  kinds of their speciality beers for poker last night and the Orange Blossom Blend was a hit.  The pumpkin wasn&apos;t as well received, but I thought it tasted like Christmas.

  We haven&apos;t spent much time in Hayward.  Its the bigger city just north of us.  Jack and I had gone to a really lame greek fest there a few years ago, and we bought our spa from a store there,  Our pool is just over the border, and one of our local &quot;malls&quot; is there, but for the most part we kind of avoided hayward, driving through on our way to other places.  What I hadn&apos;t seen was the down town as been revitalized and the city is really coming together.  I plan on exploring this city to the North a bit more.
