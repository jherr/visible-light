I&apos;m loving the Wii.  I would not have stood in line at Wally World at 2 am to get one before, but now that I know the Wii I think I probably would - with some hot coffee and ugg&apos;s.

I&apos;m not sure what I love best that Megan plays it loves and dances as she bowls or that i&apos;ve got the record in golf!  a sport I can&apos;t do in real life - i&apos;m currently at -2.

Anyway the Wii is awesome- well made, great games - very cool system.
