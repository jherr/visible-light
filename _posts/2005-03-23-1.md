&quot;IMAX theaters in several Southern cities have decided not to show a film on volcanoes out of concern that its references to evolution might offend those with fundamental religious beliefs.&quot;

This story  [from CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/23/volcano.movie.ap/index.html)  offends me.  To not show this movie because of evolution is ridiculous.  the offending goes both ways - This non-religious, evolution knowing, thinking for myself, person is  equally offended that you won&apos;t show something and let me make up my own damn mind!
