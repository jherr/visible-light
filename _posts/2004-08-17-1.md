2 shots down, this morning I did it myself...Sadie has  eaten her  meals with her meds and i&apos;ve run around the yard twice to catch her pee in a small container and this morning she had no Ketones which is great.  - Ketones are bad!

I still need to pick up one testing strip that humans don&apos;t use much anymore because of the advances in blood monitoring!

on another front... I may have found a baby sitter.  We shall see.
