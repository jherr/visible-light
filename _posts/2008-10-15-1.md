I finished cutting all the fabric for the costume.  There are 12 separate pieces that make up this pattern and some of them were cut 3 times! So cutting has been a chore, but it has also made me so grateful that I bought the cutting table that I have no room for - I could lay out pieces all at once because the table can be made to be big enough, and this was just such a huge improvement over previously projects.  I also could leave it at a moments notice and not have to worry about clearing it for dinner, or have to clean the table each time I wanted to cut.  I was feeling a bit silly for it but this project clearly put it to use, and I&apos;ve only just begun.
