Russell is back for the next 2 weeks.  We are very happy to have him.  He arrived at 10 this morning and then Megan and i went off to do some shopping.  When we returned Russell was no longer in yard but next door in the neighbors yard, crying cause he didn&apos;t think he could make the jump back over.  He destroyed some small bushes in there flower bed, before I got him to jump up with the tennis ball bribe and I pulled him by his collar back over to our side of the fence.  Now he is cuddled up on my lap very grateful to be back.
