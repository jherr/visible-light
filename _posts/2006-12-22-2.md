Megan woke up fairly early and cuddled with me who was still trying to sleep.  She wanted some water which I let her have at 9 am since that was around 6 hours from last puke.  It stayed down for 20 mins, long enough for me to shower, and then I had my own bedding to clean. 

She watched some TV, then asked to play Wii only when we got out there she said she just wanted to watch so I played some golf and when I realized she was passing out I switched over to TV, and carried her back to her bed- she slept for a couple of hours and woke with a fever so I chanced it and gave her Tylenol.  She kept it down and with in an hour was a new person. She moved to my bed again and watched more tv.  By early afternoon she&apos;d held down a little water too.

Tonight she had plain rice and a piece of toast and seems to be feeling 70% better.  I&apos;ll know more after another nights sleep.
