When you own a senior dog with a multitude of medical issues, like Sadie, you know its only a matter of time before you have to say goodbye.  Each new change in behavior is like a trumpet signaling the end.  Sadie is around 14 years old, she has pancreatic enzyme deficiency and is diabetic, she is almost completely blind. She has been fairly healthy otherwise, full of energy and life.

Last week Sadie didn&apos;t eat for 2 days - probably just a result of something she ate in the yard, but still it scared me.  Her appetite is back now.  We got her groomed on Saturday and she seemed to bounce back, but last night she again seemed slower, less excitable.   

We&apos;re giving her lots of love & cuddles, And I know some of you are saying - she&apos;s just a dog... but she has been such a good friend and protector.  She guarded Megan when she was a baby - would come and get me when she cried.  She has since we got her, watched the house at night, checking on each of us and spending time in the front and out back. (this I figured out when I was pregnant and couldn&apos;t sleep).  She really is a wonderful dog, who the following quote was written for:
&quot;I hope to be the person, my dog thinks I am&quot;
