Finally watched the Amazing Race ending.  IT really is the most intelligent of the so called &quot;Reality Shows.&quot;  I was thrilled that the gay couple the so called &quot;chip and Dale&quot; by the other contestants won.  They really were united more so than any other couple on there.  The groups of Friends for the most part played the game with out taking mean swipes at each other, but for couples who have made life long commitments to each other it was these two gay men who were kind and loving through out every trial on the show.  They really did an excellent job of showing that same sex relationships can be just as loving and dedicated as those of opposite sexes, even more so sometimes.  I still wish the circus clowns had won  - they were the best, or the two old fat guys, the total underdogs.  But if my first two choices had to loose then Chip and Dale were the next best winners.
