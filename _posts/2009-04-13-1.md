Megan and I are off tomorrow for a road trip through Redwood Country.  We&apos;ll be visiting a Jelly Bean Factory, some caves, a lake for a boat ride, and A museum.  Then we are on to Eureka - the original gold mine town before heading back south along the pacific coast highway.  We&apos;ll probably cut across early so as to not have to go through San Francisco on the way home.  The hotels I&apos;ve book so far have wi-fi so energy willing, I&apos;ll blog from the road and share.
