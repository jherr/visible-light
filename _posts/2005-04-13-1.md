I just paid 2.529 for gas at Costco, not great but better than most places around here.  I was amazed to pay over 2 a gallon in Texas, and Florida both.

Still in Australia we were paying close to 3.50 a gallon, but then we drove very little and relied heavily on the tram system.  

Hey Heather - what are you guys paying for Gas in Hawaii?  I think I&apos;ll add a side to my blog and update it each time I get gas with what I&apos;m paying - it&apos;ll be down toward the bottom - as my side bar is getting very full.
