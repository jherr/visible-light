I went out to move the truck the other day for the bug man (so he could get closer to the house) and noticed the gas cap and door were both open.  I closed them and when I started the truck noticed the gas was considerably less than full.  We had recently filled the tank so some one stealing the gas is the only conclusion.  I just returned from a trip to the autoparts store where I purchased one locking gas cap.  Who shall I blame this one on - the gas was stolen because most stations around here are in the 2.60+ range.  Anyone who watches our house knows that truck doesn&apos;t move much.  etc etc etc.
