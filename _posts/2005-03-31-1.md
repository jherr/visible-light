I saw the new Miss Congeniality and while its not even worth a review I was struck at how William Shatner who was born 1932, had a  Mother in the movie played by Eileen Brennan who was born in 1938.  Then this morning I was watching &quot;Lost&quot; which dad recorded for me and the Character Locke played by Terry O&apos;Quinn  born in 1952 has a mother on the show (in flashbacks) played by Swoosie Kurtz who was born in 1944.  Now at least she&apos;s actually older but not by much.  Not that I expect better from Hollywood when they continually give us movies like  [Autumn in New York](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0174480/)  where Richard Gere (1949) and Winona Rider(1971) are love interests.  Its all a tad annoying!
