I&apos;ve been unable to blog because of a glitch.  It was fixed a week ago but I&apos;ve been busy so I never figured it out.  I had a ct scan with an injection of cortisone for my hip.  The pain is greatly improved, but I&apos;ve now my lower back is sore - I think its probably from 6 weeks of doing nothing and will try to to just deal.   I do have another follow up scheduled for this coming thursday on my hip, I&apos;ll mention it to him if its still bothering me.

We also got a puppy!  Her names is Mimi and you&apos;ve never seen such an adorable creature.  I will post pictures up soon - or rather get Jack to do it for me.

The boys are handling her well.  Oso actually likes her alot - he stays back, because at first she was terrified of him, but they have been found cuddling and sleeping together.  Little guy is going to take a bit more to warm up on her.   He was absolutely bent out shape when she first arrived, but has since realized that she will play - which Oso doesn&apos;t enjoy doing all that much.  He isn&apos;t sure how much he&apos;s allowed to put her in her place, and she doesn&apos;t seem to care.  I think they will be friends in a very short time.  He just has to get used to her.
