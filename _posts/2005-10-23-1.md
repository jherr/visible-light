After a little coaxing, Megan agreed to try on her piglet costume ... here she is...

I managed to finish the head piece today, with one quick trip to the store for a slightly wider bias tape.  The one they called for was so thin I couldn&apos;t pin it straight let alone sew it on.  But I like the finished look and over all I&apos;m proud of the first major art project i&apos;ve finished (except for some ornaments I beaded a couple of years ago for family).
