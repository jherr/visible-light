I was wondering how we keep loosing the hamster while she was in her big pink ball. Last time she&apos;d snuck out the open garage door when we weren&apos;t looking and had wedged her ball under the table saw.  So last night we looked there first, and we looked under Megan&apos;s bed cause she sometimes goes there too -and then we started looking around.

Course this time the dog (Oso) had actually picked up said ball, taken it out side and opened it. Hamster survived, hiding under the hose and covered in dog slobber.  Oso didn&apos;t hurt her, he is gentle with play things.  We gave the hamster lots of yogurt treats for her bravery.
