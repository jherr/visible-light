We went up today after Megan&apos;s little gym class and picked up Oso for a weekend visit.  He&apos;s a very sweet boy and has already climbed into my lap and given Jack belly for scratches.  He and Sadie explored the back yard together and now we are all watching Elmo Dogs with Megan before her nap.

He&apos;s sweet and smaller, and thinks he&apos;s a lap dog at 45 lbs.  He&apos;s all black with some brown marks.

We&apos;ll keep you posted.
