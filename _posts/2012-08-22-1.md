Last summer Megan did scuba diving at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. One of the other kids there had a father that I knew I&apos;d seen before so I snapped a quick pic with my cell phone.  Well watching TV just now he was on a commercial.  I knew he was an actor! When I looked up his name I discovered he has been in at least one episode of every crime show I watch  from Bones to CSI.  so I&apos;m not crazy!

I&apos;m amazed that I remember seeing him and that its actually still in my brain when I can&apos;t seem to remember things like the word for knife, or why I walked out of a room.<br />
