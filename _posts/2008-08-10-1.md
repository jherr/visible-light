2 nights ago Robin and her 2 girls rolled in.  I can&apos;t believe they both have now graduated from High school, or that Sam is going to be 21 next month! 

We hung out all day yesterday.  Robin and I cooked dinner for everyone while Dad and Pat headed to Mass in the afternoon.  I made Beer Butt Chicken and Bread, while Robin made a salad and entertained me.  The Girls entertained Megan who was so tired last night that she literally fell asleep before I got out of the room.

Robin and the girls and I stayed up watching Olympics, playing Parcheesi and waiting for Mike and his crew to arrive from Texas.  They basically drove the whole day to get here and pulled in around 1 am.  

Today we&apos;re off to breakfast first and then lots of hanging and reminiscing.  Robing and the girls head home today, but the texas cousins will have lots of time to play with Megan this week.
