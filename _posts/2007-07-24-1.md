Its been a long time since I dreamed about a video game.  Years ago  we got into Sonic the hedge hog for the Sega genesis and I remember dreaming about collecting rings - its lasted months where the rings would be in my dreams about other things.

Now its Mario Paper on the wii and last night after Poker I played for an hour before forcing my self to go to bed - then I tossed and turned wondering what to do next, what I might have missed.  Now I have to finish this game so that I can sleep again.
