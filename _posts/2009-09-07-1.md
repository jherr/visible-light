We&apos;ve been geocaching a bit this weekend- Yesterday we found one that was straight up a hill.  Today we searched for 3 and didn&apos;t find any.

But what we did learn was Oso is a great dog off leash.  He hiked a bit a head but stopped and looked back regularly - and he always came when we called him.  He loves to fetch a stick and when we broke up into 2 small groups - Megan and Jack down into a creek bed while Little Guy and I stayed up on the patch - and Oso  - he ran between the two groups back and forth - making sure we were al OK.
