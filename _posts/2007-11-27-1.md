Megan and I both had doctor appointments today.  Megan had her 5 year check up.  She was so proud to be able to take her temp under her tongue.  While we waited for the doctor she twirled around in her paper gown.  Megan lit up when the doctor came in, and She entertained her singing songs from school and retelling Annie in great detail.  At the end of the exam, after her doctor informed her she is &quot;Practically Perfect&quot;, Megan smiled coyly and said &quot;I know&quot;.  She got a Flu shot and as we headed out and bumped into doctor again, and Megan ran over and gave her a big hug.  

After I dropped her a school, I then headed out to my ortho.   He assured me that i&apos;ve recovered and unless I&apos;m in  pain after the new year, I&apos;m done.  Despite a fax from my PT, he and I agreed that I could go with out more PT.  I&apos;ll just continue doing what I&apos;ve been doing - Ice, stretching etc. Until my foot feels so good I forget to do what i&apos;ve been doing.  

When I picked Megan up at school I told her teacher I had an all clear and could now volunteer in the class, I start this thursday! i&apos;ll be there for about an hour.
