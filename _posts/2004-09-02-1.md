Megan and I headed out this morning to Half Moon Bay.  I love HMB... its a charming community and had it had more than a mountainous one lane road in and out  I would have insisted we live there, but it was not to be... The ride to HMB today included 45 mins of sitting still, so in the end we made the right choice.

so today Megan and I met up with a friend and her son and we went to the beach.  Seals came right up close to the beach and tried to get dogs to come play... one did and it was a hoot to watch them swimming around together.  Megan and I got wet and sandy... though I miss the warm water&apos;s of the florida Atlantic coast (I&apos;m glad I&apos;m not there this weekend).  After we enjoyed the sun and the surf, we loaded up in the car and headed down town to a thai restaurant that had yummy satay.  A pleasant ride home and now Megan is not napping in her bed.  I&apos;m showered and awaiting my date!  (Jack and I have a sitter tonight and we are doing dinner and movie)

I took the good camera and got lots of pics... including an attempt at a panorama...so watch this space for more pics :)
