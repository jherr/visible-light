Earlier today I went to a open house for a house in our neighborhood - its on Michelle Way about 3 streets away, its listed at $660,000 which is outrageous!.

Anyway the realtor was really nice and didn&apos;t seem to mind a noisy neighbor.  We chatted and then I looked around.. when I went in the MasterBedroom a bird flew at me... turns out i was a mocking bird.  I called the agent and offered to help get it out.  She shut the door and I went through the room and opened the window, pushing the screen out - the bird mean while flew around and around finally smashing into the window and knocking itself out.  Now with the window open we knew it could get out if it woke up, and I said my goodbye and got the heck out of there.

Then After movie club, I drove up to our house and saw not one but 3 dead baby mocking birds!  Very sad moment when Jack and I went out and picked them all up.  Very strange bird day indeed.

BTW the movie for film club was  [March of the Penguins](http://wip.warnerbros.com/marchofthepenguins/)  which was really well done and very enjoyable.  Sort of added to my for the birds day.
