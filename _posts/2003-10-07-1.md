I voted.  This morning Jack watched the wiggler while I ran out to a local garage and cast my vote.  - on a new fangelled computer voting machine.  I was the 15th person to cast a vote on that machine.  They are predicting a high turn out, but  didn&apos;t have to wait in line and I just drove by again and there was no one there, just the 3 girls working the polling place.  Doesn&apos;t look good for Gray.

we shall see
