Megan&apos;s b-day is tomorrow and we have a houseful coming.  I&apos;m going to start cooking this afternoon, the house keeper is cleaning for me right now, and Megan is getting bigger by the second!  I thought for sure she&apos;d be walking by now cause her desire is  there but she hasn&apos;t gotten the balance thing down yet.  I&apos;m kind of glad as I&apos;m enjoying her crawling - its so adorable to here slap slap as she crawls down the hall.  Yesterday she and I explored the front yard while we were waiting for daddy to get home and she loved crawling on the grass, or rock or what ever else she found.  She picked leaves up and organized some white rocks and had a grand time.
