Megan has become a flirt with men.  A week or so ago when I took her to get her hair cut she spent the 20 minutes we were waiting for our turn talking to and entertaining a guy who was  there to fix the tv.  He was in my opinion slimy, though probably in reality harmless.  It was the first time I realized Megan loves to talk to everyone (a bit like her mom there) and that she had yet to be taught to be wary of people she doesn&apos;t know.

Today she singled out the scruffiest looking dad at the pump it up drop in playtime and befriended him and played with him.  He was nice and he and I started chatting once I realized she wasn&apos;t leaving him alone, but it kind of bothered me. 

Both incidences are harmless, and yet both show that she has no sense of stranger danger, and both scared the *&%^$^ out of me.  Its time to get the ball.  

I found out from a mom friend that one of the local police departments has a program for toddlers.  She&apos;s going to try and get it organize for our group.  Any one else have any advice on the subject?
