Its raining and storming so hard that neither dog will go out.  Oso has stuck his head out the dog door several times and by the amount of frantic pacing I was beginning to suspect the poor guy needed to go bad.  So ... I opened the front door and told them they could go out- they both ran out barking and right over to their favorite bushes.  Both emptied their tanks and came running back inside.  Now if I&apos;d opened the back door (which I did several times) I would have gotten that look - that look that says my human is crazy if she thinks I&apos;m going to go pee in the rain!
