Megan&apos;s got a 101.9 fever (without Tylenol, with it goes down to the 99.9 range) So we&apos;ve spent today watching movies and napping.  Megan cried alittle while ago and asked to goto school, she said she wasn&apos;t sick, though the crying made her cough which sounds like a seal has invaded her little body.  We&apos;re watching blue&apos;s clues now and she&apos;s agreed to nap after.  She&apos;s also managed to eat some crackers and have alittle grape juice.

While its awful to have Megan sick it does mean i&apos;m home and able to wait for my laptop to appear.  I got the word from apple that it is repaired and on its way.  Course I can&apos;t get DHL to tell me anything based on the tracking number apple gave me so I don&apos;t know when it&apos;ll come.   :)

will be very glad to have it back.
