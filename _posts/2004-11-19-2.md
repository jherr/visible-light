We just got home from a wonderful night.  Jen and Thom treated us all to a lovely dinner and then we enjoyed Community theater production of  [Over my Dead body](http://www.ltww.org/season.htm) .  It was a wonderfully funny play and very well done for a local theater troop.  It was a fun romp about mystery writers trying to commit a crime. The female lead did an excellent job, as did the actor who played the butler.

The best part is Megan survived the me leaving her in the care of the Bolduc&apos;s excellent babysitter with the help of Cooper and Jack who translated and played with her.  Tomorrow night Jack comes in and I&apos;m sure her night with out me will be forgiven.
