I&apos;ve spent the last week fighting a bug.  Today I went to the doctor and am now on Antibiotics for bronchitis, and eye drop  antibiotics for the eye infection that was my cold and it migrated.  Basically I look like I have pink eye in both eyes.  Both feel like sandpaper and I&apos;ve spent much time sleeping since looking out of them is actual pain.  thus the 3 days - that&apos;s about how long until the antibiotics really do their thing.  

so I&apos;ve spent several days in bed, sleeping lots since this started.  Sunday I felt better, so we went to the mall and I bought new sheets and we came home and made valentines for Megan&apos;s class mates.  But Monday dawned and I was back in bed, and by the end  of the day my eyes had started to swell shut.  And that was why  I went to the doctor this morning.
