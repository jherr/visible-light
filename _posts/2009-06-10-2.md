A few months back, America&apos;s Test Kitchen had a recipe for [ French Chicken in a pot](http://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/login.asp?recipeids=4742&LoginForm=recipe&iSeason=9) .  I&apos;ve made it now 6 times and each time I am just amazed at how wonderful it is.  The chicken is so moist and juicy.  It is also a really easy recipe.   Basically you sear the skin of a whole chicken with some onions, rosemary and garlic with salt and pepper - 6 minutes on a side - ending with breast side up.  I&apos;ve been doing this in my big pot.   Then you put foil and a lid on the pan and stick it in a 250 degree oven for around 80 minutes.  

Once done you let the chicken rest on a platter with the foil on it and mean while pour all the accumulated juice in a fat strainer (straining all the onions, garlic, and rosemary out.  Place in a pain and bring to a boil with some lemon (or lime juice).    It is delicious!
