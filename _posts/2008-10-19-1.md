Saturday was glorious.  We went  [ sailing on a catamaran ](http://www.adventurecat.com/)  with our dear friends Jon, Pam and Yvonne and all the kids.  Molly missed out because she broke her foot.  We all missed you Molly!

The day was perfect. Sunny, windy, a tad chilly.  An hour before I took some Dramamine so as to actually enjoy the trip.  We made it with minutes to spare and joined everyone on the boat.  We passed Seals on the dock and got to the boat which was a beautiful big Catamaran.  Once we were underway and out of the dock area, the motor was turned off, the sails were unfurled and we went around Alcatraz Island and out under the Golden Gate Bridge.  

The ride out was bumpy and wet with lots of giggles and we all got splashed, but the return trip was smoother and the kids got to enjoy the netted openings on the front of the boat - bouncing and laying down.  It was just such a great day.  I can&apos;t recommend it more.

After we got off the boat we headed over to the Mission were Molly got to join us and we all had a lovely thai dinner.  Great company!

When we got home, I crashed.  A cross between the Dramamine and the sake at dinner I slept 12 hours straight! - A record for me since turning 30!
