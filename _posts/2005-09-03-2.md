Megan ask for a new bed this week.  We were rocking and chatting in her room and she said Megan want a pink bed.  I said great, and the very next day we bought the new bed (all new pick bedding to go with).  Well it was delivered today, and while Jack and Megan went to SF to play with friends, I stayed home and put her room together.  I moved her dresser and bookshelf to act as bookends on the bed.  I ran up to LInen&apos;s and things and got her a bed skirt and found some really neat butterfly curtains.  I had to move the valance rod down to act as the new curtain rod.  I set up the bed with all the bedding and the guard so she can&apos;t roll out.  She has a pile a pillows and a pile of stuffed animals and well its cool bedroom if I do say so myself :)

She was so excited to see it and she said New Bed... Megan new Bed several thousand times tonight.  She loved reading books in it but not before she tried to skip it entirely and just go straight to bed.  But once she realized I wanted to stick to routine she was happy to do so.  We read, we cuddled, we sang we snuggled and in the end she was oh so happy to go to sleep.
