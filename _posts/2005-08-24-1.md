The doctor last week said I was healing better than expected and no more surgery! yeah.  

He also said i&apos;d be 80% better 6 weeks post surgery ... we&apos;ll i&apos;m just over half way there and feeling at least that good if not better.  My throat only hurts when I yawn, and when I eat really dry scratchy food like dry toast.  Otherwise no pain and i can eat what ever I like.  

So even though the week after was hell and the week after that wasn&apos;t much better, i recommend getting your tonsils out if you have recurrent tonsillitis. Worked for me :)
