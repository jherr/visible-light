&quot;During the administration of William Jefferson Clinton, the U.S. enjoyed      more peace and economic well being than at any time in its history. He was      the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win a second      term. He could point to the lowest unemployment rate in modern times, the      lowest inflation in 30 years, the highest home ownership in the country&apos;s      history, dropping crime rates in many places, and reduced welfare roles.  He proposed the first balanced budget in decades and achieved a budget      surplus. As part of a plan to celebrate the millennium in 2000, Clinton called for a great national initiative to end racial discrimination.    &quot;
