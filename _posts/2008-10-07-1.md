Megan is only taking 2 extra classes,  Ice Skating, and Gymnastics.  Yet I feel so busy.  Yesterday she had her once a month nature class at Sulpher creek, where I took the following picture.

Yes she is holding a tarantula!  Apparently they are all over this area.

After I rushed home and dropped her off before heading over to the monthly PTC meeting.  I think I feel overwhelmed because I have to get her party organized and make her costume.    And yet here I sit - cleaning out the tivo and surfing the web  - guess the pressure isn&apos;t on enough yet.
