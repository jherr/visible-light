I just watched Megan out on the pier feeding the fish with her cousins.  The last time I watched her from the window above was when we were here last  [November](/vl/archives/2005_11.html) .   It really hits you, being here that she&apos;s not.  Today we&apos;re getting ready for the memorial.  There&apos;s cleaning and cooking going on, and lots of talking.  Lots of remembering.  She was such a wonderful woman, and I count my self lucky to have known her.  

I ache for Megan, to never really know either grandma.
