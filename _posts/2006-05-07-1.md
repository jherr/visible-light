Megan has a digital clock in her room.  I bought it when she was little so when I went in to her in the middle of the night to breast feed I could tell what time it was.  Recently however its become handy for telling her when she can and can not get out of bed.  The rule is when the clock says 7 something its ok or 8 or 9 but not 6 and not 5 and definitely not 4.  Its worked really really well.  Surprisingly well.  Megan proudly announces the hour when she gets out of her room in the morning - &quot;Mommy its 7!&quot; 

well today I installed a new light fixture and had to turn off the power to which included Megan&apos;s room.  So tonight when I was setting the time I decided to set it 30 minutes late so that instead of coming in first thing tomorrow right at 7, I&apos;m guaranteed an extra 30 minutes in the morning.  I&apos;m so excited!
