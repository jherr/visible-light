A hike this morning at Meyer Ranch, with Megan Jack and both dogs.  Now I&apos;m canning tomatoes from our garden - so far I have 10 jars boiling.  Jack is picking me up some more (hopefully larger).   I basically chopped the tomatoes and cooked them down with a little bit of salt, some acid from a lime, a head of garlic.  Then I put a basil leaf in each jar before adding the mix.  Its been a few years but I still remember the last winter that we had canned tomatoes - yum !
