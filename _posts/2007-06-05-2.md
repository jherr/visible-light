 [The relay for Life is at the end of the month. ](https://www.kintera.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=192226&lis=1&kntae192226=A7F3424B1A744232B2C36C2932ABFEDC&supId=171513076)  I thought I&apos;d throw this up for another run at getting sponsors.  I&apos;m scheduled to walk from 10 to midnight for my team, i&apos;ll probably hang out for much longer and cover any potty breaks the walkers need or just keep the walker on the track company.  

Anyway, please donate if you can, and thank you to my supporters! (So far that just you Jacqueline!)
