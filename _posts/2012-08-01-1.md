The drive here was uneventful.  We managed to make it through the alphabet twice finding words outside the car that begin with each letter-  Thanks in part to Xtra trucking and Quality Inns.   Our final z didn&apos;t come until dinner though when I looked at the wine list.

We stopped in Gilroy for lunch and a little shopping.  During lunch I attempted to download a book on tape but it didn&apos;t finish, so we were book less.  Hopefully remedied for drive home.

OUr hotel is fairly nice.  Nondescript from the street, but rooms are nice, beds are comfy and the indoor pool perfect on a 90 degree day. After swimming we walked up the street a bit - but all the shops were closed and so we headed back and had dinner at the hotel.  Restaurant was really dark, and warm but we split a pasta dish and a salad and a dessert and it was all yummy.

Stayed up way to late watching Olympics but between the girls gymnastics team gold and Michael Phelps reaching 19 medals - how could we not.  

The morning brings big plans.  after breakfast we will find Ostrichland, explore Solvang, swim again in pool.  After dinner we have tickets to the local theater company.  

Happy Birthday Daddy!  <br />
