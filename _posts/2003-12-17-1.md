So I&apos;m leaving borders this morning after Megan and I enjoyed story-time, when I hear the helicopter over head announce &quot;come out (a word I didn&apos;t get) or the police are coming in&quot; - nice!  

As I drove home I past the neighborhood next to Hollywood Video with police at every corner and the whole area blocked off.  I called the local paper in hopes of finding out what was happening and ended up tipping them off, so when I got home I called a couple of the local tv stations too.  I&apos;ll let you know what the reporters find out :)

exciting!
