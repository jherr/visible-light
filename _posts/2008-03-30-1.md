Megan has been off, like so many other kids in America, this past week for spring break.  Because it came so early in the year we never ventured to our pool despite it being open.  No after  a rather calm and relaxed easter weekend, Megan hung out with our neighbor on monday while I got my eyes checked,  And we hung with friends on tuesday before Megan had her last ice skating lesson.  We also said good bye to dear friends who moved back to Australia tuesday.  They are the type of friends we see too few times but always feel so connected when we do get together.  We will miss them.

 Wednesday we loaded up the car and drove south - stopping in Gilroy and Monterey before driving highway one through big sur.  We stayed for 3 nights in San Simeon, which if you didn&apos;t know is where William Hearst built his Castle, and it being the only castle I could think of that I could drive, is where Megan and I decided to explore.  I hand wrote a lovely blog entry which I may or may not get around to typing up because I didn&apos;t want to forget anything and my laptop decided to have issues (I&apos;m blogging from Jack&apos;s machine at present).  

We got home yesterday evening, and have spent the better part of today just getting back to that being at home feeling.
