I&apos;ve learned something about Megan tonight - she talks in her sleep - she keeps saying things and with Jack out of town and the dogs sleeping  its quiet so  i&apos;ve been listening.

&quot;Where&apos;s my baby...&quot;

&quot;Bring that here&quot;

&quot;I like the pink flowers&quot;

makes me wonder what she&apos;s dreaming.
