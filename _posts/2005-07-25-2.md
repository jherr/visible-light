I just signed the online petition for the California Clean Money and Fair Elections Act, letting Governor Schwarzenegger and our legislators know that we demand that they fix our broken campaign finance system!

I think what the California Clean Money Campaign is doing is extremely important.  Clean Money public financing of campaigns will hold politicians accountable to the voters because voters pay for political campaigns rather than big money contributors.  This idea is making things better in other states and California deserves it too.

So check it out,  [sign the online petition if you live in California](http://www.caclean.org/ ) , let me know what you think, and pass it on!
