Megan&apos;s first word was &quot;Happy&quot;, this of course doesn&apos;t take in to account Dee which clearly had meaning.   She now says Dinner &quot;Dean arr&quot;, Bird &quot;birr&quot; Ball &quot;ba&quot; Mommy &quot;ahmmy&quot; and daddy &quot;daddy&quot; she has also said the following but has not repeated them often - goldfish, Grandma, Jenny, Pops, Milk.

She has lots of other sounds and talks constantly with perfect conversation like inflection.  I need to record her jabbering away this week so we can keep it and embarrass her later.
