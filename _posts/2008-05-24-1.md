Jack brought home the [ Wii Fit.  ](http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080524/FEATURES08/805240386/1033) which if you don&apos;t know if a balance board that registers how your standing and allows you to do some great exercises.  I was leery at first because I tend to doubt the benefits of anything like this.  But after 2 30 min workouts I feel stronger already.  I&apos;m even enjoying running (with the aid of a good sports bra).

It is weird having something in the house know my weight , but I passworded it so only the wii and I are wise to the actual number - something I don&apos;t like sharing.

If you have a Wii - go get Wii Fit  - you&apos;ll love it.  The yoga poses are fun - the aerobic activities are great - we all been playing it  - standing up and getting physical with a computer game!  If there is more than one of you in your house - you&apos;ll wish you had a Wii for the other TVs too so you can all play it at the same time!  (Jack and Megan will be back at it tuesday and then the Wii Fit is all Mine!
