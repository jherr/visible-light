Contrary to rumor I&apos;m ok.  Jack&apos;s ok too and so is Oso.  However it turns out one of us calls people in our sleep.   Well we called my sister Robin that is.  I&apos;d left the phone in the bed and one of us found it in the night.  We woke her up at 1 our time and through out the morning I was sought after by several family members she&apos;d alerted.  It wasn&apos;t until I was on the road on my way to Ikea when my brother David got ahold of me and was able to tell me what had happened. 

When I got home I found the phone still in bed, still on, though the battery was fading fast.  I called Robin and assured her we were fine - and apologized for waking her up though we slept through the whole thing.

Don&apos;t worry - the phone is not in bed.  Its on the charger - well at least that one is :)
