About 6 months ago Jack and I made a conscience decision to start  [Hampton Inn](http://www.hamptoninn.com)  vs Comfort) based on buying blue when I&apos;ve had a choice because they both met my other needs (2 room suites where Megan can sleep and I can still stay up).  

Its been empowering.  For once I feel like I know more about where my money is going and its  really going where my mouth is.  And why not - why not support those companies who either stay out completely or lean towards my politics.  Its a great idea, and it give me cause to think when I do go into a red store - &quot;do I really need this item?&quot;  

Course shopping mostly at Costco means we have lots of TP and papertowels, and still alot of the products we buy in blue stores come from red company&apos;s but its a start and maybe someday company&apos;s will realize it pays to stay out of politics.
