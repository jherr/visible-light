Megan and I went out to lunch today.  One of those places that gives a free scoop of ice cream to kids with their meal.  This place actually adds a bit of chocolate sauce and Megan loves to mix it up and proclaim she has chocolate ice cream.  

Today while stirring she said Mom - I have a great idea.  We can add chocolate syrup to milk and stir it up and make....


Chocolate Milk!
