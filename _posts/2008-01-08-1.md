Megan has been singing this refrain repeatedly since her class performed it at the party before break.  Funny thing is we lost our Santa so I too was wondering where oh where is St Nick?

You see we had the absolute best Mall Santa, from 2002 when Megan was 2 months old to 2005.  He  apparently was here much longer because local people with older kids would see my pics with Megan and him and say he was the same one their kids had gone to.   You may remember ...

And then last year we went to the mall excited to see him - The real one I&apos;m sure and we were faced with a new one - see this years pick - adequate but not the real one!

I thought maybe he&apos;d kicked the bucket, or retired or anything... 

SO today I&apos;m standing in the line at the grocery store - flipping through the a trashy magazine and who do I find!...

Chris - if you get this plea - come back to us! Better yet - HOLLYWOOD - give us our Santa Back!

Actually i&apos;m just going to have to take Megan down next year to  [To visit him at the LA mall](www.westsidepavilion.com/)
