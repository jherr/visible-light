I saw my ortho doc this morning.  I&apos;m still in the boot, but can gradually get out of it and move over to a hard bottom ortho shoe.  He said I should wait though till I start Physical Therapy and they can&apos;t see me till monday so its the boot till then.  Physical therapy will be for the next month twice a week.  Man I can&apos;t believe I did this to myself.
