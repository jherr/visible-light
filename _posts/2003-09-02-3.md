Jack&apos;s book I found listed on http://shop.bookworms.org/aws.cgi/mode_books/kind_AuthorSearch/search_Jack%20Herrington/ 

Not only the great review but the google link had a sales rank in the 22,000 but the page updated at 20,000.  He&apos;s selling books.  I noticed also that our local borders is sold out with more on order.  This is so exciting!
