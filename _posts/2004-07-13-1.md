Megan fell asleep last night by 8, was zonked in my arms as we listened to music before bed, and she s just starting to stir now -its 8:50 am.  One missed nap and we&apos;re back on schedule.

Today we are off to Little Gym.  It&apos;s our teacher Ms Kendra&apos;s last day and we will miss her, and its our last day for a month.I&apos;m glad we have such a big break since we are loosing our teacher.  When we come back it will all be new.

The pool yesterday was nice,  For a change Megan was the only kid in the baby pool except during adult swim when we were overwhelmed.  It seemed to be dad&apos;s day as I saw lots of kids with dads and granddads but  I felt like the only mom.  I think that will be our last trip there till we get back.  Guess that&apos;s all for now.
