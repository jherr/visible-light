Motherhood is the most incredible experience of my life.  The most fulfilling job I&apos;ve ever taken on.  But there is an aspect that I never expected and really could do with out.  It&apos;s the whole &quot;oh yuck what&apos;s in my mouth, let me spit it out and hand it to Mom thing. &quot;  today I received a half chewed grape and some veggie sausage. 

I&apos;m perfectly fine with diapers and illness, but I&apos;ve always had a aversion to spit and the half chewed spit out food thing just takes my aversion to a whole new level. :)
