We&apos;ve gotten our money&apos;s worth this year.  

Megan and I went to GA again today - we set out to watch all the shows - We got there at lunch, Megan did a few rides and we ate, before heading in to watch her Ice Skating teacher in the Ice Show - Endless Summer.  Megan insisted we sit up front and and so Rebecca actually noticed her and waved and smiled when she had a chance.  Megan was delighted!  After we headed over to  and then Megan got her caricature done (Something she&apos;s been wanting for a while).  Then we rushed over to see &quot;Ed Alonzo - Misfit of Magic&quot;  Again we sat right up front and Megan laughed so hard.  After we rushed again to see the Dora Show before finishing up our day with a few rides.  We left and met Jack at a restaurant for dinner before coming home.

Pictures from the day - iPhone quality.
