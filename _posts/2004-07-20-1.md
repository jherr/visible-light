Megan is a fish.  We have spent 3 days here and each day she  swam in the lake.  Today she figure out how to float on a Noodle.  She is amazing. Today we spent the whole morning at the beach playing in the water and sand.  Sharon even caught a fish in the kids toy net.   We had fun splashing with Cooper and Jack too.
