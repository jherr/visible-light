we&apos;re at the airport in Greenville having dinner, but I will first update you all on my shitty afternoon.  I put a pan of water on to boil to make Megan some Edemame for the ride home.  I sat down and blogged and got sucked in to a cheesy movie about Diana.  Well when I remember the pan the water was gone and the bottom had melted.  I pulled it off the stove and liquid metal fell and splattered all over the ground.  This I missed, so I of course stepped in it, burning a huge hole in my sock and my foot.  It hurts like hell, on par with labor.  I&apos;m planning on several cocktails on the plane, and would have started now with dinner but South Carolina is a dry state on Sundays!

Tomorrow, after some sleep I will go to the urgent care center near the supermarket and let them doctor it up, till then I have neosporin and bandage.

Update:  We made it home, all exhausted, Jack and Megan sleeping.  I just redoctered my foot and am heading to bed as well.  Had to blog this update though for the east coast folks.  I had 3 vodka tonics on the plane and that helped a bit, so did 2 ice bags.  Now I just need sleep.
