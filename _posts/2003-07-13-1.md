Instead of a movie today, while Jack was hiking with Megan, I went to Hallmark to see the new crop of ornaments.  The whole time  I was there I bumped in to memories of mom.  It truely is the place I feel closest to her.  They have several new ornaments that I know she would have liked, and several more that reminded me of her - one is a nursing ornament.   So if your missing her, or just want to reminisce head down to Hallmark.
