Yesterday during Megan&apos;s nap,   got an annoying call from some company Jack had visited on the web. At first I hung up on the woman as a phone solicitation, but she called back so I listened to her for a few seconds and realized that yes this was probably something Jack looked into.  So I took down her number so he could call her back, all the while she was offensive and condescending. She repeatedly told me her service might cost 100 a month and did I know that, not once but at least 10 times over the course of the conversation.    I finally got her off the phone, called Jack and thought that that would be the end of my involvement.  Well the same moron called at 6:30 this morning.  When we didn&apos;t pick up the first time through and she got the machine she hung up and called again.  I thinking only family call this early and it must be an emergency answered it and she said to me Hi What are you doing right now - Sleeping I told her - her reply &quot; what on earth are you sleeping for&quot;  that&apos;s when I recognized her voice and I yelled back is this that company yes she said I replied DON&quot;T EVER CALL HERE AGAIN.  You know what she said just before I hung up on her - why did we contact you before?
