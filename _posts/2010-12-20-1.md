After Jack and Megan pulled out Saturday for Oregon, I realized I had seen dogs in the video for the house - so I emailed the manager and she assured me we could bring Mimi.  So she and I drove up yesterday.  

We are about 3 stories down a cliff and so our cell phones don&apos;t work in the house.  It is breath taking and beautiful here, and this morning we allowed Mimi off leash and she tore through the beach and surf delighted to be here.   It has been alternating between raining and sunny and being on the coast we can watch the band of rain come in off the pacific.  We still got trapped yesterday - far from the rental down the beach and had to come running back in a hail storm.  
 
Mimi is doing fine,  She did pop her knee out again today but with a little pressure I helped her get it back - she has been doing too much jumping, however she did sit in a crate for 10 hours yesterday on the drive up so she did get some forced rest on her knee.<br />
