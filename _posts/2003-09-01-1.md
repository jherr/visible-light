I&apos;ve got a touch of a stomach bug, and as I think back to all the food I&apos;ve eaten in the last few days, I&apos;m starting to blame the cream cheese from our favorite bagel store.   When Jack got home yesterday morning from the bagel shoppe I spread some cream cheese on my bagel took one bite and said it tasted strange.  I did throw it out, but I&apos;m guessing one bite was enough.
