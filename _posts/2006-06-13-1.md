I&apos;m a bit pessimistic about where this country is going, the health of our planet, and future for mankind in general.  But when it comes to my personal life, i&apos;ve never been happier.  

Today is Jack and my 14th anniversary.  We got married so young, and over the years mutual admiration really turned into something spectacular.  

I had planned on taking Jack to see &quot;World Sumo League 2006 Mega Tour&quot; and had the tickets, sitter and surprise all set up. Jack and I got into Sumo a few years back when we went to Japan.  Anyway - the even has been canceled.  Now I&apos;m also out an idea for Jack (the most difficult person to shop for)  Jack sent me a couple of ideas but not at all the type of unusual  gift I was going for.  I mean Sumo that&apos;s pretty unique!  

We&apos;re heading out to dinner tonight.  Hopefully inspiration will hit and i&apos;ll have a great idea soon.
