I thew out about a gallon of frozen breast milk yesterday.  It had been victim to the freezer incident of 2004, but more than that it was over a year old and no longer had a willing consumer, as Megan likes her milk either fresh from the cow or chocolate.

I was so concerned early on that I wouldn&apos;t have enough milk, that I pumped and pumped and pumped.  Turns out, I had more than enough.  I think we&apos;ll probably go on till she&apos;s 2, unless she decides to quit sooner.
