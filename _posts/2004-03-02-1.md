I went to www.selectsmart.com and was told that based on my views on specific issues the following are my candidate choices:

1. Your ideal theoretical candidate.  (100%) 
2. Clark, Retired General Wesley K.,  AR - Democrat  (75%)  
3. Sharpton, Reverend Al - Democrat  (75%)  
4. Kucinich, Rep. Dennis, OH - Democrat  (74%)  
5. Dean, Gov. Howard, VT - Democrat  (70%)  
6. Moseley-Braun, Former Senator Carol,  IL  - Democrat  (68%)  
7. Kerry, Senator John, MA - Democrat  (68%)  
8. Edwards, Senator John, NC - Democrat  (66%)  
9. Gephardt, Rep. Dick, MO - Democrat  (63%)  
10. Lieberman, Senator Joe, CT - Democrat  (43%) 
11. Bush, President George W. -  Republican  (19%) 

I love that Al Sharpton is high on my list when I didn&apos;t really think he and I had much in common. And I&apos;m not surprised bush is at the bottom of my list, I&apos;m just wondering how he managed to get a 19% out of me.  I think Clark isn&apos;t even on the ballot any more, so even though he would apparently be my number one pick, he&apos;s out.  Maybe I&apos;ll go with number 2 or 3... funny I thought I liked Dean but he&apos;s forth and no longer running.
