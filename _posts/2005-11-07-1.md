We have a bit more than a month til Christmas, and so I feel the urge to start shopping.  I&apos;m making my lists and checking them.... On my side of the family, we draw names for one adult (and spouse) and then give to all the kids, so I have 10 kids to shop for.  I like to give fun, yet educational gifts to my neices and nephews.  Things that require thinking, and maybe give some entertainment during rainy days or snowy days depending on where they live.  

I&apos;m Also in the mood to decorate, but since we haven&apos;t even had thanksgiving, I&apos;m trying to hold off - though I reserve the right to start on or just after thanksgiving - depending on when I can get Jack to get the trees down from the attic (thats right trees!) one for the living room and one for the dinning room.  Jack usually does the outside lights and I do the inside decorating. 

I think what&apos;s put me in the mood is that Jack and I got our fireplace working this weekend.  After having our second string babysitter stand us up on Saturday, Jack ran and picked a new screen and some wood, and I took the plywood down from the front from when we baby proofed for Megan - so its been a good 2 years since we had a fire, and it just makes the whole house smell wonderful and with the chill in the air, I feel as though it should be christmas already.
