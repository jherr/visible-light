In case you haven&apos;t noticed (refresh already!) I made up a new masthead for the blog...I&apos;m a newbie on fireworks and maybe my next one will be more complicated -my goal is just do it - update my mastheads more - maybe once a season.  - so Happy Spring!

UPDATE: I set up all my old  [mastheads on our wiki ](http://www.muttmansion.com/wiki.cgi?VlMastheads) so that you can see how its changed.
