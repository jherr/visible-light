The barfing has subsided.  She went for about 5 hours in the middle of the day with no throwing up so after she handled alittle drink, i went ahead and let her have some toast - well that came back up.  It was a day of cat naps and movies.  It was also a day of lots of laundry.  By 8 o&apos;clock tonight she was climbing all over us and the bed, and enjoyed playing in her bath.  We read books and sang songs and she happily went to bed.  She did ask for dinner a few dozen times but I assured her she didn&apos;t want to eat.
