I Tivo&apos;d Kerry&apos;s appearance on David Letterman 2 nights ago and really enjoyed watching it when I saw it last night before bed.  I look forward to hearing more from him and watching him in the debates and we learn more about this great man.  For those of you who missed it he did the &quot;Top 10&quot; for David and it was a hoot - see for your self.

Kerry’s “Top 10 Bush Tax Proposals” are:

10. No estate tax for families with at least two U.S. presidents.

9. W-2 Form is now Dubya-2 Form.

8. Under the simplified tax code, your refund check goes directly to Halliburton.

7. The reduced earned income tax credit is so unfair, it just makes me want to tear out my lustrous, finely groomed hair.

6. Attorney General (John) Ashcroft gets to write off the entire U.S. Constitution.

5. Texas Rangers can take a business loss for trading Sammy Sosa.

4. Eliminate all income taxes; just ask Teresa (Heinz Kerry) to cover the whole damn thing.

3. Cheney can claim Bush as a dependent.

2. Hundred-dollar penalty if you pronounce it “nuclear” instead of “nucular.”

1. George W. Bush gets a deduction for mortgaging our entire future.
