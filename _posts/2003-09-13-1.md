Megan and I had a great time at Bryce Harrison&apos;s 1st birthday party/safari.  This was the 5th birthday party from our playgroup.  We&apos;ve got another one later in the month then Megan and then one more before we are done until we start up again 6 months later 

Jack and I managed to clean out the garage somewhat.  We got a storage unit and also got rid of some stuff.  We put a sign on the front for free stuff and got rid of 2 monitors, a christmas present we got that we never used that was 6 years old (kitchen appliance) and a bike seat.
