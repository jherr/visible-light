 Today might have been my favorite day so far.  We got up and ate breakfast before heading out  First we did the Subway Lawa TUbe, which was dark and erry and I&apos;m very proud of us for going all the way through.

fuzzy shot of both of us deep in the cave  the only one I took so its all I&apos;ve got

Then we drove on about 40 mins more and went to Burney Falls which is also on Lake Britton.  After viewing the falls we picniced and then headed down to the lake,  Megan got in and started swimming,  I stuck my foot in and realized I would never get my body in such cold water.  So while she continued to play in the water and I sat on our blanket and watched and then started Sketching the scene in front of me.  She built a sand castle, while I colored in the lake and the mountain beyond and all the pine trees on it.

We drove home via Burney which is a supprisingly large town and found a run around with the hose car wash, so we got a layer of dead bugs off the car.

Back to the KOA an hour or so later, and we swam, made dinner, built a fire, roasted Marshmellows and I tried to remember words to songs and we entertained each other.

we are out early tomorrow - heading home, but not before going to the southern entrance of lassen and stopping by the wild horse sanctuary.   <br />
