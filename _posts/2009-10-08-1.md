Jack and Megan left on the tandem bike (one seat and wheel with peddles attached to normal bike) to head to school - so I sat down to drink my tea and read facebook, when I heard Megan come running up the walk.  Thinking the worst I ran to the door just as she opened it and said - &quot;Momma I forgot to give you a hug and a kiss!&quot; How sweet is that - my whole day is made.
