That means I don&apos;t have to sit through that stupid preview one more time.  I will admit the first time I saw it it peeked my curiosity. But it has played before each movie I&apos;ve seen for the past 3 months!  I probably won&apos;t see it now that the critics have panned it, but I am glad its finally opening so that I can see previews for something else.
