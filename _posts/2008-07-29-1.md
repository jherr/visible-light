&quot;Alvarado Middle School Student Died July 22 in Las Vegas

UNION CITY (Tuesday, July 29, 2008) * Friends and community members
have set up a memorial fund for the family of Catlynne Shaw, an Alvarado
Middle School student who died July 22 , six days after her heart
stopped while she was riding a roller coaster in Las Vegas.

Catlynne, 12, suffered an apparent heart attack while riding the Canyon
Blaster roller coaster at the Circus Circus Adventuredome on July 16.
She was revived with the help of an off-duty firefighter waiting in line
for the ride, and was taken to University Medical Center, where she died
last Tuesday. Officials said it could be several weeks before a cause of
death is determined.

Catlynne, who attended Eastin Elementary School, had just finished
sixth grade at Alvarado Middle, where she was a straight-A student. Her
brother, Stephen, also attended AMS. The family was in Las Vegas because
the children*s grandfather had died the previous week, their mother
said.

Services for Catlynne were held in Las Vegas, where she was buried. The
family now plans will move to Las Vegas, her mother said.

A memorial fund has been set up at Bank of America, 1900 Decoto Road,
Union City. Contributions can be made to the Catlynne Shaw Memorial
Fund.&quot;
