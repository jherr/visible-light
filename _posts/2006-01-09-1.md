the difference between a 3 year old and a 35 year old with the same bug, is that the 3 year old forgets she&apos;s sick and plays on.  I spent the great part of the last week sleeping.  When I was awake it was to moan or complain.  Megan who has ignored the whole being sick part, has enjoyed a much quicker return to health.  I know I could learn something from that... but i seriously doubt I could put it in practice.
