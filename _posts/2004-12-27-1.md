So Jack and I have begun the quest to find that new special someone.  To share our lives with and to spend money on.  To cuddle with and to go for long walks with.  You guessed it we&apos;re dog hunting.  Yesterday we went to the  [Petfinder](http://www.petfinder.com)  that I liked but by the time I called the group he&apos;d been adopted.  The same group has 2 beagles rescued from a research facility. One of them has caught  my eye so it looks like we maybe getting a beagle.  We&apos;ll have to see how Sadie and the other dog gets along.  We&apos;ll keep you updated.
