Jack and I decided to take Megan out for date night when she was so jealous of our date night last week.  SO last night we went out to dinner at her favorite Italian place and then we went and saw Ice Age 3.  We all had fun and the movie was so much better then the reviews would have you  believe.  We all liked it.
