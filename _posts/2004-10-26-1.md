We went to Megan&apos;s Doctor today for her 2 year check up.  She is 27 1/2 lbs and 35 inches tall.  She sat ever so patiently while the doctor looked her over and checked everything out.  She started kissing me as the visit ended which was really cute.  After her single shot, we went to lunch at Sushi Harbor (Megan loves sushi!) and then to Target in search of a rain coat - but no luck.

On the way to the dr we drove through sheets of rain and hail, which scared me but made Megan giggle like mad.
