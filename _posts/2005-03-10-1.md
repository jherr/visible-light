Megan and I arrived in Tampa yesterday evening.  &quot;Ganba&quot; picked us up at the airport and after a quick dinner at TGIF&apos;s we drove to Ocala.  The flights were much more uneventful than our time out  last august.  Though the airline did convert our one stop same plane to a plane change with little time to spare and a good distance to run in Houston.  Megan&apos;s diapers leaked through all the clothes I &quot;carried On&quot; for her so she got a new outfit in Houston complete with Cow Print Diaper cover.

She fell asleep last night easily and is still sleeping soundly this morning.  I got up to have some coffee.  The extra bedroom is so bright, I need to hang some blankets (or towels) over the curtain rods  so I can sleep in tomorrow. Especially since Megan has pretty much given up her nap!

I can&apos;t email out - but when dad gets up I&apos;ll get him to help me rig the means to which I emailed out last summer.
