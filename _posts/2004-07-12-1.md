Megan went to bed last night at 8:30.  When she was still awake at 9:30 I went in and tried to tell her sleepy time - she said &quot;baby Baby&quot; because she wanted to play more with Josephine, Pam and Yvonnes daughter.  they had been over in the evening and the 2 girls had run around and around.

Megan slept in today till 11.  She&apos;s now enjoying an apple before we head out to do some shopping and get lunch.  We&apos;re going to go to the pool today during her usual nap time and then hopefully she&apos;ll go to sleep at her a more normal 8.  Of course on Friday we leave for a month on the east coast and all bets are off as to when she goes to sleep and when she wakes up while we are there.
