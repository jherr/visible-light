Just as I was putting Megan down for bed, we had an earthquake.  Megan and I went for her door just as Jack was coming in to get us and then it was over.  Some dishes I&apos;d stacked in the dish drain fell over, and the dogs food storage container fell on the floor - but thats it.

Megan went down despite the experience and is sleeping soundly.

Now I will go and be rocked to sleep - gotta love aftershocks.
