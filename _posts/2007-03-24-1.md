I have a bunch of liberal bias bumper stickers, i&apos;ve been adding to the back of my CRV since the last presidential election.  They include &quot;Vote Against Hate in 2008&quot;, &quot;Marriage is â™¥ + â™¥&quot; and one about Bush&apos;s legacy - you know Death Deficit and Deceit.   My favorite sticker is &quot;God Please save me from your followers&quot;

So i&apos;m coming out of my local supermarket and I see a guy and his teenage son standing behind my car reading and pointing and laughing.  When the see me approach they get all shy and disappear around to the other side to their car.  As I get in I hear the dad say to the son ... 

&quot;So that&apos;s what a Lesbian looks like!&quot;

makes me wonder what people think when Jack drives my car ;)
