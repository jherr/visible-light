Megan and I are off on a road trip today.  Heading to Solvang for 2 reasons - one to show her a little bit of Denmark, my favorite part of my child hood, and the other to find Ostrichland USA.  Last week at the California Accademy of sciences we discovered we both love Ostriches - and they got theres from Ostrichland - so a road trip was born.
