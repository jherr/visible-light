We pulled out of the house a little before nine, and stopped at our  [favorite coffee shop ](http://www.paddyscoffee.com) for refreshment on the way out of town.<br />

The drive was not monumental.  We made it to Redding in time for a late lunch.   I&apos;m listening to a library book that I was able to download through my local libraries website, which is very cool.  

We pulled into Oregon before 5 and had found ourselves a dumpy little hotel soon after.  I wish now we&apos;d driven around a bit more.  Our first room was adequate but had a broken shower, which I discovered after we swam in the pool and I wanted to rinse off the excess chlorine and bugs.  I had already ordered a pizza too, so we had to wait by our old room to pick up the pizza before moving into our new room.  This room is pretty dirty, but the shower worked.  I will yelp them and tell people to avoid it, if cleanliness is at all an issue.  

After showers and pizza we settled into bed and watched some Trek.  Night night - we will pull out early tomorrow and explore the area before heading up to Crater Lake and the black out zone - no blog posts till saturday at the earliest.
