I&apos;m back from Florida and barely on the net.  My laptop froze on the plane out and never came back.  I have to goto the apple store this week and get it fixed, but first things first Megan has her 3 year check up in the morning.  So no email for a while.

Florida was good, sad and happy all rolled into one.  I&apos;m pretty sure its the last time I&apos;m going to see my old dog Buster and Muffy his sister.  The are old and health failing fast.  Also knowing it was my last night in my &quot;home&quot; from high-school.  But it as a happy occasion too.  Dad was so happy.  Seeing him get married on saturday and seeing an extra bounce in his step.  Its wonderful to see Dad so happy.

Now I&apos;m home after being in the middle seat all the way home and I&apos;m pooped.  Megan was so ecstatic to see me.  It felt so good, to come home.
