Yesterday we had 15 people at our Thanksgiving table.  We feasted on Turkey with all the trimmings.  Great conversation, libations, and music. Wonderful friends and family.  I&apos;m so thankful that the dishes all got magically cleaned and put away. (Thank you Pam and Jack and anyone else who jumped into the cleaning).

Today we&apos;ve started the christmas decorating.  Tree is up and half dressed.  But we are taking a break to head off to the movies.  no black friday for us.  I avoid all stores today.
