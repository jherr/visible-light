This weekend flew by.  Megan&apos;s birthday party was alot of fun.  I had all the food prepared ahead of time so I got to enjoy everyone&apos;s company.  Megan laughed alot and seemed to really enjoy all the attention.  After everyone was gone we opened all her gifts.  she was really taken with Elmo from Grandpa and a set of keys from one of her playgroup pals.  Today she enjoyed her walker and her Leap pad.  She also got some shape sorters and stackers and had a blast taking them all apart.  

I went to a rather depressing movie today &quot;my Life without me&quot;  I went because of the lead - Sarah Polley who was in the show Avonlea.  I didn&apos;t realize it was a movie about her dying of Ovarian Cancer,  I was a bawling mess by the end.  Overall it wasn&apos;t that bad of a flick, but I don&apos;t know why movie makers think we want to escape to be depressed.
