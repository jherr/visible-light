Jack and I had our most unusual date night last night.  After Meeting with the accountant about our taxes for the first hour, we drove up to the city, parked then wondered around Nob HIll looking for anything to eat in 45 mins.  We found a small deli, got sandwiches, hiked up a really steep hill and then sat outside the Masonic Center, listening to the lunatic Fringe.  Once we finished inhaling we headed inside and presented our tickets for ...   [City Arts & Lectures will present an evening with Vice President Al Gore](http://www.cityarts.net/n.gore.html) 

He was funny, engaging and fascinating.  Everything I never expected from him, till I saw his movie last year. He did start out kind of slow, with his every lick smack fully mic&apos;d but once a heckler was removed from the audience, he lightened up and the mood of the whole group changed.  It was a good hour of conversation and then he answered a few audience questions, but none that I would have asked.  My questions is &quot; will you be running for president next year?&quot; but I knew he wouldn&apos;t really answer that and so I didn&apos;t bother filling out the form.  I can&apos;t seem to find the schedule of when it will be on the radio but if you get City Arts on your local NPR keep your ear out for it.
