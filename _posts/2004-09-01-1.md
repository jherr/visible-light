I made really bad coffee this morning.  It was yummy last night when Jack made it, so the beans are fine.  It was simply me.  Was I too tired to .... boil water and pour over ground beans, wait, plunge... how did I make a bad pot of coffee?  it shall be a mystery for me today as I go about my business.

Megan and I have a few errands today, to get Jack some new clothes, and to get a 
&quot;metal Rod&quot;  (I&apos;m thinking of a Simpson&apos;s episode now) so that we can hopefully find the sewage clean out in the front yard.  Blueprints are only kept for 5 years in this city, so our only hope is finding it ourselves... somewhere in the yard.  Hopefully not under the front walk.
