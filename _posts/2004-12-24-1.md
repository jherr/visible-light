&quot;<a href=&quot;http://spaceweather.com&quot;>FIVE PLANETS: On Christmas morning and every morning after that for more
than a week, you can step outside at dawn and find the five brightest
planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) sprawled across the
sky. It&apos;s a beautiful display easily seen without a telescope. </a>&quot;
