On the idea that we didn&apos;t really want to spend time at home this weekend, We headed down highway 1 to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.   With the holiday weekend on the parking lots were full and we had to find street parking.  Once we&apos;d located enough quarter (at 15 mins a pop) to ensure our car would be there when we got back to it we went and had an early lunch before braving the Aquarium crowds.  

The members entrance was thankfully empty considering the ticket lines were around the block.  The aquarium was fairly full and we only got to see a few of the tanks in the new Shark exhibit.  We headed up to the outer bay and Megan enjoyed her usual running around.  However with the crowds Jack and I were both on chasing duty.  Once we were both tuckered out and Megan looked tired we left and headed out of the aquarium and back to the car.  

Usually we spend so much more time in the aquarium.  But by the time we had finished lunch and wondered through half the aquarium, the place was filled beyond capacity.  It was overwhelming for us all.
