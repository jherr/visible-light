Oso doesn&apos;t kiss us.  Anyone who met Ripely and even Sadie knows we&apos;re dog kiss people, but what kills us about Oso is he kisses anyone else who walks through the door - including workmen, friends and babysitters.  I liken it to his begging for someone to take him from this hell.  Jack says maybe he respects us too much.

So I did a google search and came up with...

&quot;<a href=&quot;http://www.dogtrainingguide.com/tricks.htm&quot;>Kiss
This is a fairly simple trick where you get your dog to lick you on command. Simply say &quot;Kiss me&quot; anytime your dog licks you. As an incentive you can put peanut butter on your face for him to lick off and say &quot;Kiss me&quot; while he is licking it off. After a while your dog will &quot;kiss&quot; you anytime you give the &quot;Kiss me&quot; command.</a>&quot;

How do I get my dog to start kissing? Do you think since he wouldn&apos;t kiss me for steak or chicken on my cheek - peanut butter would actually work?  Any dog lovers out there got an idea for us?
