I&apos;m taking an email break for the next 7-10 days.  Apple kept my mac and sent it out to get it worked on.  So I won&apos;t be blogging that often and I won&apos;t be checking email, unless I go crazy and take Jack up on his offer to rig something up for me.  I&apos;m thinking of it as a test, to live without email for a week.
