Monday came and we had our weekly poker gang over.  I was out of money around 9:15 in the same pot that cleaned out Mel (Way to go Jack) so we headed into the living room and watched the Season Finale of  [Dexter](http://www.sho.com/site/dexter/home.do)  which is in my humble opinion the best thing on TV.  For those of you living under a rock, Dexter is a serial killer, who during the day is a forensic investigator for the Miami Police Department - I&apos;ve read the books its based on and the show is so much better written.  The finale was off the hook good.   I can&apos;t wait to rewatch it with Jack, now that he&apos;s not taking everyone&apos;s money.
 
Can I just recommend any one who&apos;s not squeamish - go rent Season 1 and get hooked.
