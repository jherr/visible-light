Cleaning ladies are coming tomorrow, so I spent the last half hour straightening up the house.  Earlier I took all the throw rugs out to the laundry and started doing them in batches.  Clean house deserves clean rugs.  Trouble is Oso is dependent on them to get around the house - so we have more than we need just so he doesn&apos;t get trapped in a room.  Taking them all away at once is torture.  Bad Mommy.   I only just realized that he has been trapped standing in Megan&apos;s bathroom for the better part of the evening.  The way I got him to the bed was putting a bath mat down.

I&apos;m also a bad mommy because I left the hamster in her ball all night - at her age 3 hours of exercise is a bit much.

Megan told me tonight though that she is glad I&apos;m her mom, so I guess that is the important one.<br />
