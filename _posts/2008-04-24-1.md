I may appear grumpier then usual, but its just that i&apos;m so incredibly exhausted.  I&apos;ve been volunteering at Megan&apos;s school alot lately - this week its the book fair.  I finish that today with another 3 hours of moving books around, and doing math in my head - Last night I ran a cash register for 3 hours, and it didn&apos;t do the whole change calculation for you - so I did that on the spot in my head - it felt good to stretch those brain muscles, but after the first hour I was tired of it - and grateful for anyone who came to my register with a credit card!

I&apos;m also tired because I&apos;m suddenly doing everything around the house.  Jack&apos;s wrist is better, but he shouldn&apos;t over do it - so for example, I&apos;m cooking dinner, and cleaning up after, I&apos;m doing all the laundry and dealing with the trash.  On sunday I actually spent several hours just cleaning because the little tasks I do daily had been pushed aside during the surgery week.  I just didn&apos;t sleep last week because of the stress of it all.  

SO this morning I&apos;m in Megan&apos;s class for a few hours volunteering and then I head over to the book fair to help with the after-sale and clean up.  I&apos;m not complaining, not one bit - I love it and really I&apos;m so grateful, i&apos;m able to spend the time helping make Megan&apos;s school wonderful.
