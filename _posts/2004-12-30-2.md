I met another mom for dinner and a movie tonight.  We saw  [Life Aquatic](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362270/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxzZz0xfGxtPTIwMHx0dD1vbnxwbj0wfHE9bGlmZSBhcXVhdGljfGh0bWw9MXxubT1vbg__;fc=1;ft=1)  which was a good if odd piece of cinema.  I was entertained and would recommend it to any one who likes those weird quirky types of films.

The entertainment actually started about 2/3s of the way through the picture.  I was sitting in the back row - in order to limit the conversation behind me.  To my left a few seats away was a young couple, quiet through most of the film.  Then they started getting friendly.  Next thing I knew they were getting very friendly, lots of kissing and moaning and fabric being rubbed.  Then the guy said load enough for me to hear... I need you ... lets get out of here and go ...  she replied OK and they left the theater.  Now I had to let my mom friend in on what happened... she had actually been watching the movie.  We had a laugh with the young guys in the row ahead of us who had noticed the activities as well, and then proceeded to enjoy the rest of the film.
