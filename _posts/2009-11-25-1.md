So far I&apos;ve brined the bird, steamed some pumpkin and started some bread.  The bread is for the stuffing so I still have to bake it slice and dry it out.    Very grateful for having an extra small fridge in the garage.  With out the shelves its big enough for turkey in my big chili pot to brine over night.  

I&apos;ve half decided to make the pies tomorrow so they are fresh.  I&apos;m making an apple and a pumpkin. One small pumpkin for our friend Mel who can&apos;t have gluten - so no crust.
