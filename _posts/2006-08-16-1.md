While dad was here he fixed a few problems.  The most incredible was that our sticky garage door (from kitchen to garage) was fixed with 2 toothpicks inserted behind the upper hinge.  NOw it not only closes smoothly but damn if the lock does lock.  I&apos;d never thought it fixable - and just chalked it up to the house settling.  He also shaved a hairs breath of wood from behind the hinge in the bathroom and now it shuts too.

Plumbers putty applied to the back of the new wall plate in the shower (behind the on/off handle) keeps it attached to the wall (though I did have to remove a smidge after he left so that we could turn the water off).

He also instructed me on the art of replacing washers and now the hose in the back no longer leaks.  The hose up front doesn&apos;t leak on the hose ends but does in the valve so I think when I have a plumber come out and replace the sink assembly in the garage I&apos;ll have them fix that too.

Its always great to have the fixer come visit.  If he&apos;s coming to see you - have a list ready :)
