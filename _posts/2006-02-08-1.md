I&apos;m in Shorts - its February and I&apos;m not only wearing shorts but I let Megan play in a outdoor water play area today at the Hub shopping mall.    I have windows open.  Since we moved here we have had wet cold Februaries.  But today and yesterday and the day before have just been perfect.  More Perfect than our summer because everything is still green, so its warm and sunny and green.  I hope it lasts but  [The Weather Channel says](http://www.weather.com/weather/tenday/94587?from=36hr_topnav_undeclared)  we should be getting rain back next week.d
