at the risk of sounding cheesy - I can&apos;t wait till DISNEY!

Megan and I leave on Thursday to meet Uncle Doodlebug and the rest of the casa De Newf clan at WDW in Orlando.  We have character meals almost every day - with Breakfast with Pooh, Lunch with all the princesses, and Dinner with Mickey.  We&apos;re also going to the very Merry Christmas party on main street one night!

Megan is tall enough to ride Thunder mountain railroad! and a couple of others that i love.  She&apos;s an couple of inches shy of Space mountain unless we use some of her thick heal shoes. :)  The kid loves  coaster and rides so this is a perfect year to go!

Ok Enough gushing!
