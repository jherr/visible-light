Did you happen to catch today&apos;s Oprah.  First off i don&apos;t usually watch it, but she had my man Anderson Cooper on as I was surfing and so I stopped to see what was up.  Well it was a whole show from Louisiana and Mississippi.  The had a woman on who is still using a bucket as a toilet, and living with out a roof next to an open sewer and FEMA is telling her we&apos;ll get you a trailer soon - this is 6 months later and we are the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  How can we even think to tell the rest of the world how to live if we can&apos;t even take care of our own? How is it that we as a nation aren&apos;t stepping up.  Its embarrassing that the rest of the world sees us as the most powerful nation and we have this large area that is living in 3rd world conditions - a full 6 MONTHS AFTER KATRINA!  Just another major failure of our current administration.  Instead of fixing the problems... they are just placing blame.

Anyway - Oprah repeats here usually in the late  night hours, so if you can record it. and watch it later. - oh Just saw on CNN that they are going to rebroadcast parts of it.
