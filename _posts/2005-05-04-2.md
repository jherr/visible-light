&quot;On Sunday morning, Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson told TV viewers nation-wide that the threat posed by liberal judges is &quot;probably more serious than a few bearded terrorists who fly into buildings.&quot; When an incredulous George Stephanopoulos asked if Robertson really believed that these judges posed &quot;the most serious threat America has faced in nearly 400 years of history, more serious than al Qaeda, more serious than Nazi Germany and Japan, more serious than the Civil War?,&quot; he responded, &quot;George, I really believe that.&quot; [1]&quot;

I doubt that this would do any good but  [Move On](http://www.moveonpac.org/)  is doing a petition about it.  Go ahead and sign if you too feel this is just plain disgusting behavior in any one considered a &quot;leader&quot; in our community.
