This week has been so tough.  Not only did I watch as my country made a huge mistake, but I didn&apos;t have you here to give me a hug, and to give me an ear to vent.  I missed our conversations in the dark at night, I missed your council.  You are my best friend. We&apos;ll get through these next years, because we&apos;re together.

How fortunate I am that I have you in my life.  We have so much we share and value .  I know people who have topics they can&apos;t discuss with there spouse, and others&apos; who have secrets they can never tell, and I realize how fortunate we are to have each other.  I know we&apos;ll always have those little things that drive us crazy - like my leaving paper towels in the sink and you leaving your pants on the floor, but those things don&apos;t matter.  What matters is your a great father, a wonderful husband and my best friend.  .... this little public display of affection is just to say thank you for being you and I love you.
