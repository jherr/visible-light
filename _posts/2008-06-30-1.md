Megan and I talked Jack into heading down to Great America for a few hours on Sunday since I&apos;m a big chicken and don&apos;t like rides - Megan would be able to ride lots of them with him.  We got down there by 10 am when they opened but discovered they only opened part of the park then and we had to wait a full hour for all the rides to be up and running.  One Ride that was open was Psycho Mouse.  While standing in line for this ride, Megan befriended a girl named Lauren who was there with her Nanny Jen (Hi Lauren Hi Jen!)  They all chatted and enjoyed the ride, before heading in different directions.  We went over to Survivor the Ride and the Grizzly -  Megan wasn&apos;t too sure about Survivor but really liked the Grizzly  (an old fashion wooden roller coaster!).

We wondered back over to Nickelodeon central and Jack and Megan rode the roller-coaster there.  By then we decided it was time for lunch and so we headed over to the Nike Cafe - only to find Lauren and Jen finishing up there lunch too.  They headed out to do a ride while we ate and then the girls decided they wanted to ride the Nickelodeon roller coaster together.    Several times on there and we headed over to the Ragging Rapids.  I ran out to our car to get our swim gear and then we all changed and played in Boomarang Bay -where we tried out the wave pool, the Lazy river and water slides- We ended up hanging out together through the rest of the day - parting in the parking lot - where the now good friends - Megan and Lauren hugged goodbye. 

Here are some pictures from our adventure... enjoy...
