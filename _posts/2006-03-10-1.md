Sadie has a big swollen face.  I took her to the vet this morning after watching it grow for 2 days and not really comprehending that there was a problem.  I just kept saying to myself - man Sadie&apos;s putting on weight, or in this light Sadie looks strange.  Then last night I finally felt for myself under her chin and realized she had a growth of some sort.  The vet thinks its an infection but did see a few questionable cells under the microscope.  So we&apos;ve sent it off to a lab to be looked at, and meanwhile she&apos;s on antibiotics.  I tell you she&apos;s a brave dog but I&apos;m not sure how much more she can take.   - as long as she&apos;s comfortable and happy.
