Tonight Megan and I read one of her &quot;Blues Clues&quot; books.   In this one Blue and her friends goto the fair and they each use blue&apos;s stuffed dog pokadots to ride a scary ride.  I pointed out to Megan that she took her girlie doll on lots of Rides at Disney and asked if it helped when she was scared...  

&quot;No silly mommy&quot;  

&quot;Girlie is my baby - i helped her not be scared!&quot;
