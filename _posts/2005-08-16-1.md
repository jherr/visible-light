I took Megan to  [Bonfante Garden](http://www.bonfantegardens.org/)  yesterday, with my dear friend Jennifer and her son Bryce.  The kids had a great time playing in the smallest water play area, riding some of the rides, eating &quot;not bad for park&quot; food... so much so that when I told Megan it was time to leave and drive home, she didn&apos;t want to go - I suggested we leave and go find Daddy and she said &quot;no no go find daddy&quot; ... we need to feed the dogs I said, she said &quot;daddy do it&quot;  Grasping for anything I remembered the  Dvd player in the car and said what movie do you want to watch on the way home?  
&quot;Piglet, yeah!&quot;  and so we left, but not before stopping at a outlet gift shop just outside where Megan found a fancy Rabbit doll and by fancy I mean complete with pearls and faux fur shawl, for 49 Cents ... couldn&apos;t believe that one.

I took a few pictures, and will add the link when Jack give it to me.
