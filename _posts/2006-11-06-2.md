Today at Science class, a class Megan takes once a month at Sulpher Creek in hayward, the teacher passed around the lid to a coffee can that had been chewed on by a wild animal.  She asked the kids to guess what animal had made the teeth marks.  

She went around the room and got the usual suspects - Deer, Raccoon, Rabbit, Cat, Bobcat, etc.. then she got to Megan who looked ever so proud and said...

&quot;I know, I know.... an Octopus!&quot;

The teacher and all the mom&apos;s giggled and she told Megan that was a very creative guess.
