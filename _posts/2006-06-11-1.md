I realize  [this is one republican in just one state,](http://www.thestate.com/mld/thestate/news/local/14400031.htm)  but it represents so many bigger issues.  What a waste of time and money for the state of South Carolina.  I&apos;m sure the people of South Carolina have bigger issues on their plate than whose selling sex toys. 

Its the same thing on the national level.  We have major issues facing us, like war in Iraq, and Global Warming, poverty  and new Hurricane Season, and yet Republicans wasted time  last week trying to out law marriage between two loving and consenting adults when they knew they didn&apos;t even have the votes for it.  

Can you tell how fed up I am!
