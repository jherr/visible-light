Last nights dinner was so good and easy.  I&apos;ve promised to type it up for some friends.

a package of (4-6) Chicken breasts or (10-12) thighs. 
1 small can crushed pineapple 
1 can tomato sauce
1/3 cup teriyaki sauce
1/3 cup shoyu (or low sodium soy sauce)
3-4 garlic cloves (crushed or minced)
2 TBs brown sugar
lots of freshly grated ginger
one small onion chopped or sliced
red bell pepper or yellow sliced
pinch of red chili flakes (or more)
1 TB corn starch mixed with cold water

spray crock pot with cooking spray. place slightly still frozen chicken crockpot, top with onions and peppers
in a bowl mix together pineapple with juice, tomato sauce, teriyaki, shoyu, garlic, brown sugar and chili flakes if using.  mix well and pour over chicken.  Cook on low 8-9 hours.  

When chicken is done, shred with 2 forks, return to crock pot with all the juice.  Add  and stir cornstarch mixed with a bit of cold water, and allow to cook until thick.  about 5 mins more.  Serve over rice with chopped spring onion or cilantro on top. <br />
