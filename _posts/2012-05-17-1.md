We&apos;re perfecting the art of the stay cation this summer.  We have a few small trips planned but nothing bigger than a weekend.  We are going to goto Murphy&apos;s and Angels camp which is a gold mining town - because Megan studied California History during 4th grade.  We are also going camping one time. 

I&apos;ve thought of Houston and Florida, but really I don&apos;t want to get on a plane - The idea of travel is exhausting - I want simple this year.

We have Season passes to the local water park, and a friend just put in a pool, so water is covered.  

We&apos;re going to have a reading and writing time every day too.  An hour of quite - non electronic time after lunch.

but ... to fill the rest - we&apos;ll be exploring a few new parks and ...

when ever I hear I&apos;m bored - 

we must ...

pull a slip of paper from the jar...

and do what ever it says...

should be a great summer!
