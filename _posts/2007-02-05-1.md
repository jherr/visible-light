I decided this morning to swim a mile and a half.  The first mile went smoothly, I spent it dealing with my head phones which wouldn&apos;t stay on and switching between the fast and the slow lane depending on the number of swimmers.  At the end of the mile I felt great and figured I&apos;d go ahead.  

I did the next half mile with very little trouble, and by now the pool had cleared and I was splitting the fast lane with another swimmer.  All was right with the world.  Ended that half mile and still felt great so I decided to go for 2 ... Jack does it all the time so why not me ...

Well it all went ok but by the 1 and 3/4 I was pooped.  I could barely get my arms out of the water for that last 1/4 mile, But I did it and though I didn&apos;t have any energy left - not even to walk over to the Jacuzzi  I did have a nice long hot shower before picking Megan up at school.

I&apos;ll probably add the half a mile regularly but i&apos;ll keep the 2 miles for when I really want to kick my own ass.
