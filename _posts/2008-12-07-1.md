We celebrated a Victorian Christmas today at [ Ardenwood Farm.](http://www.ebparks.org/parks/ardenwood)   It really was a wonderful day.  We got there after an early lunch.  We got there just as the train was loading so we all boarded and headed to the back of the park where the monarchs winter.  They had already left the trees, but we did get to see a few flying around.  We walked over to the main barn yard where the out door kitchen was making lots of yummy delights.  We did all the arts and crafts, did a little shopping and  saw the victorian Santa before heading over to the tennis courts and watching a puppet show  with marionettes.  It was a great show that lasted about 10 minutes too long.  I figure it was just me, but when Megan came up from siting in the front her first words were - wow that was long!

The only sad time came at the beginning when we found out  [ Tucker ](http://www.flickr.com/photos/54445018@N00/448465652/)  had passed away recently.
