Having lived in Miami through hurricane Andrew, and knowing we have so many family and friends in the sites of Frances, it is so surreal to watch the coverage and be fearful for our love ones while we have such wonderful weather.  

We&apos;re thinking of everyone in Florida on both sides of our family and hope every one is safe.
