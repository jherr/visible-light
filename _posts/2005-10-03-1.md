While Megan is in school I&apos;ve been taking a once a week sewing class at  [Seams Dreamy](http://www.seamsdreamy.qpg.com/) .  Well I&apos;m working on a piglet costume for Megan and the damn strips on his body are killing me.  I can&apos;t seem to stitch them on with out the zig zag zigging.  i&apos;ve already had to tear out the same strip twice.  I know Renee will make it all better thursday, but its frustrating not to be able to get this one part done.

NOTE: yes dad I tried sewing it with paper on the back.  It didn&apos;t really help.
