No one teaches you how to put shoes on someone else&apos;s feet.  I bought Megan and good pair of shoes and watch the guy at the store put them on her with no trouble.  The next day I couldn&apos;t get Megan&apos;s shoes on easily - I&apos;m talking 20 mins of trying and then trying again.  She would bunch up her toes and they would end up on as if she had fat stumps instead of feet.  We&apos;ll Saturday we went out and played with our neighbor Darlene and she took on look at Megan&apos;s feet, laughed and said &quot;first kid&quot;.  

She had Megan sit at the curb and in just a few seconds she had them both on straight - I sat there dumb-founded with my jaw on the pavement, but watching her was enough -  I can put them on now in just a couple of seconds.
