The pool was glorious this morning - crystal clear and the water was so smooth - There was only one other person in the whole pool when I started and I had a lane to myself until my last 4 laps.  Even when I left there was only 6 people in there.  

Jack gave me a iron man watch so I was able to count not only my laps but also my actual swimming time - I always thought that since I did stop occasionally to catch my breath or chit chat with fellow swimmers that if I swam for an 1 1/4 hours then i&apos;d have a mile - well today I did a mile in 41 mins which means i&apos;ve been doing way more than a mile for some time.  It was a tough work out since it was the first one back in a week and while i had great plans to get on the elliptical trainer or walk around Lake Elizabeth, and meet with a personal trainer - non of which I did during my week off.  But it feels so great to be back in the pool again!

So I have this week on and then next week off - but next week we&apos;ll be in Oregon with a few hikes.  Then we get back in time for the swim around the Great Barrier Reef - 37 mile swim Jack and I are going to do starting in January.
