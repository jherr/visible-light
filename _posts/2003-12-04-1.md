Last weekend I saw these 2 movies.  Elf was funny and well done.

The Missing I didn&apos;t expect much of.  Most critics have not liked it and I&apos;m not a huge fan of westerns.  But in honor of my mom who loved westerns I went and it was really pretty good and I know she would have loved it.  So I recommend it to anyone who likes westerns and even if you don&apos;t its a pretty good movie.
