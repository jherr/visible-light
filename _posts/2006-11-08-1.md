i&apos;m in a state of giddy excitement and relief.  Not only do we have Madam Pelosi speaker of the house, Rumsfield finally out! and the senate looking very blue, but I&apos;m going to Disney tomorrow -how sweet is that!   

I&apos;m going to miss watching Little guy Duncan and Oso play - they are right now and its a hoot.

I swam for around 2 miles this morning since I won&apos;t be swimming for a while.  I&apos;m feeling great.
