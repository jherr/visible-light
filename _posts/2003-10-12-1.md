I read in the paper about &quot;the best greek festival in Northern CA&quot; so Jack, Megan and I went.  It was the saddest affair ever.  It was at the Hayward Civic center which to start with is run down and dirty.  Litter and broken glass were on the path from the parking garage to the Hall.    The people seemed half hearted and tired of the whole thing, The traditional music seemed slow tempo and the wares seemed more like garage sale items than traditional greek stuff..  

My fondest memories of Miami include going to the greek festival at the greek orthodox church on 107th ave across from Barnes and Noble.  I just remember an energy and had a wonderful time each time I went.

The baklava yesterday was tasty and we did met a really nice Monk on the way out and bought a jar of apple sauce from him, but over all it was a disappointment and we&apos;ll skip it for years to come.
