Saw legally blond 2 yesterday and while I expected it to be corny I was appalled at just how bad that movie was.  I think Ebert must have taken some money to give it 2 stars.  There were a few funny moments like when a conservative gun slinging congressman realizes his dog is gay.  But even that one funny bit was over played a dozen time through out the rest of the movie.  Reese Witherspoon and Sally Field along with the rest of the cast should annonce that they only did the movie for rent money and move on.   I&apos;m tempted to see charlies angels but i&apos;m sure it&apos;ll be bad too.  Not all sequels are bad, I loved the matrix so far  and lord of the rings but these are continuations of the story line more like chapters verses  new movies with a new concept same charecters.  Alien another good series of movies and not all of the alien movies were a hit, but somehow they were all enjoyable in my book.  but to make a sequel merely because the first one was a suprise hit is stupid.  What&apos;s next my big fat greek divorce and remarriage?
