Sunday was my spa day.  Jack watched Gee and I headed with a friend to the  [Claremont Spa](http://www.claremontresort.com/spa/default.asp) .  We had a wonderful day of pampering.  I enjoyed a private herbal infused bath, a pineapple and grape seed scrub, followed by a Porpalis Wrap, then I was covered in Coconut Milk.  We then had lunch in one of the hotel&apos;s restaurants, and then headed back to the Spa were I had a Massage.  The highlight would be the scrub and wrap.  I really felt like royalty.  The Massage was a little too hard and my muscles are still a little sore.  Next time I&apos;m going to try a mud wrap and a stone massage.  The next time being for our anniversary in June (I&apos;ve already got overnight siting for Megan) Jack and I are going to go for a weekend.
