Bush&apos;s  [ hometown paper](http://abcnews.go.com/wire/Politics/ap20040928_873.html)  has endorsed Kerry.  

&quot;Four items trouble us the most about the Bush administration: his initiatives to disable the Social Security system, the deteriorating state of the American economy, a dangerous shift away from the basic freedoms established by our founding fathers, and his continuous mistakes regarding Iraq,&quot; 

The link for the actual paper  [ Here ](http://www.iconoclast-texas.com/)  however I couldn&apos;t get it to load - probably to many people trying to check it out.

GO KERRY!
