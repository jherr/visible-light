A while back, you may recall we had a hell of a night you can read about it  [here](/vl/archives/001224.html) .

Well yesterday one plumber came out and recommended I hire another guy with a camera and a metal detector to find our pipe.  It is now found and he even located the missing clean-out (though it is buried under a bush. But and here&apos;s the GREAT NEWS - he didn&apos;t see any root infiltration in the rest of the pipe.  He thinks it was just one of those clogs where someone flushed something hugh!  So We can now dig down and find the clean out so we are prepared, but we can also rest easy that the Magnolia out front isn&apos;t causing any troubles.
