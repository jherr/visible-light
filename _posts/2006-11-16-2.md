We had a quiet day at Grandpa and Mumsie&apos;s.  Mumsie let Megan decorate the tree with her, and we all managed naps.  I&apos;m still very stuffed and Megan has a cough - the kind that trigger&apos;s gag reflexes.

I think we are going to try and make Happy Feet tomorrow or the next day - hopefully my coughing will have subsided.
