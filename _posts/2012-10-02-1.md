we finally have summer - its was in the 90s yesterday and will be again today - so weird.

I have a bag full of pink for Megan&apos;s halloween costume.  Probably my last year of making one for her and i&apos;m cheating and using a pair of long pjs as the base.   Pictures when its done.

We have gone all out on decorations this year for halloween.  Waiting for the lawn man today before I start building the cemetery. - pictures I promise but just an hint - We found Dracula&apos;s coffin!  and by found I mean Jack built.

Planning has begun for Megan&apos;s 10th birthday extravaganza!  she is really excited about double digits.  I&apos;m not so much.  She also is now over 5 feet tall. 

Great movies are coming -  [Life of Pi ](http://www.youtube.com/LifeofPiMovie) is one I&apos;m going to see.   Great TV right now too - Dexter is back!  I&apos;m really into Wallender and Now there is Call the Midwife.
