Very few problems yesterday and Megan and I had a great day.  We had one incident with a little old lady on the plane who understandably was upset that Megan could reach her seat with her feet, but instead of saying anything to me, 3 hours into the flight she looked over and scowled and when Megan laughed at her she snapped her teeth at her.  I apologized knowing what she was pissed about and she told me to switch seats with her...Leaving Megan alone with this crazy woman.  I told her I couldn&apos;t and to complain to the flight attendants and that they would switch her.  She refused that... but the really nice guy next to me offered to switch with her, so She was given an acceptable out.  And the beauty of it all was that Megan fell asleep as soon as they switched and never kicked the seat again.

Megan is now playing in her car, and has filled the trunk space with spoons.  When she saw the car at the airport she got so excited and it lasted all the way home.  The dogs (Sadie and our old foster Russell whom we are dogsitting) gave her a wet sloppy welcome and Russell and Megan started playing ball.  Sadie is unbelievable skinny.  But she is acting younger and happier than I&apos;ve seen her in a long time.
