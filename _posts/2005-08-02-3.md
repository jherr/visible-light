Megan loves to sit at the dinner table.  So much so that a simple meal can go on for a couple of hours, with Tears as we try to take the food away.  She eats just enough to say she&apos;s still eating.  Today I messed up and gave her too much food on her plate, so now she&apos;s working on an hour long lunch - anyone body else out there with little ones who love to sit at the table, with any ideas of how to hurry her up?
