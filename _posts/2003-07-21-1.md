As I get laundry done, and start to compile a list in my head of what to pack, I realize I need to do alot by wed noon when Megan and I go on our first trip away from Jack.  Megan I&apos;m sure will miss him, as they have really gotten some great routines down. 

I&apos;m also working on clearing out tivo so it only records shows  that dad won&apos;t have on his tv (since he doesn&apos;t have cable).

Anyway - lots to do, but &apos;m really looking forward to the trip.
