We started out the first part of the week with Megan sick.  You can&apos;t guess that by the beautiful pictures Jack&apos;s been sharing, but she was a very sick little girl.  Yesterday however she was on the mend and we managed a few errands and I had a girls night out.  Come home and I start feeling shaking and boom this morning it hits me.  Jack came home at 2 and took over the entertainment of Megan while I went to  bed.  

Hopefully I&apos;ll feel better tomorrow, since honestly my symptoms aren&apos;t nearly as severe as Megan&apos;s were.  But we missed Megan&apos;s Gym yesterday and we are skipping playgoup tomorrow so all in all its been a bland week.
