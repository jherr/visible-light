Megan and I are off for a week in Houston with my brother Doodlebug, his better half Missy and their two cuties Justin and Elise, my dad and Missy&apos;s folks Elton and Pat.  Dreading airport security with a running 18 month old, but seeing family will make it worth while. Lots to do (still packing and watching tv to clear out the TIVO for a week&apos;s worth of recording.)
