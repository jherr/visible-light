I biked Megan to school today and then spent 3 hours volunteering.  By the time I biked home it was HOT.    I decided what would make it great was a very large ice tea.  I biked over to Starbucks and attempted the drive thru.   I was denied service.  Only cars I was told - I have wheels I replied.  I&apos;ll go spend my money else where I told them.  Fine I was told.  

So I left and went home.  Annoyed, but 3 bucks richer since thats what I would have spent on the ice tea.  

What really ticks me off is Starbucks says they are a green company - but...

There is no bike rack for me to lock my bike to.  and they won&apos;t let me use the drive thru.  So they lie about being green friendly.  And they don&apos;t encourage it in others.  Shame on you Starbucks. <br />
