First i got addicted  [Mummy Maze](http://www.popcap.com/launchpage.php?theGame=mummymaze)  and all I can say is whew. . I hate getting addicted to a game its all I think about.  I&apos;m going to avoid another game for a while and try to get in to a book for a change.

ps both games were a hoot, if you like puzzle/maze type games that don&apos;t make you nauseous  these are for you.  Be prepared to give up some time (and sleep) getting them done.
