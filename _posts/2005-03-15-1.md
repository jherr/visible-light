 after blogging yesterday,  I found Pooh in Gainesville, so Megan and I drove up there and watched Pooh, then had lunch on the way back. I think today after we goto the local YMCA for a mommy and me class(thanks Missy) [unless grandpa doesn&apos;t get back with his car that has the car seat in it], we&apos;ll go to the petstore and the mother earth grocery store.

Megan is getting another tooth - which explains her mild  crankiness of late-  so now we have 8 on the top and 9 on the bottom with another one pushing through on the bottom.
