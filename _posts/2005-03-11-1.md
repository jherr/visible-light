Megan woke up at at 6:30 local time and talked to herself for 30 minutes before I got up. We watched Pooh and I played gammon while we waited for Grandpa and the puppies.  We&apos;ll going to goto the discovery Museum today, probably go run the mall, and go slide and swing at the park.

MeeMee will be getting a nap today.  We both need one and now that she&apos;s gotten up so early she&apos;s starting to get super cranky (for her)
