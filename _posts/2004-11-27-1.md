It snowed this morning.  I was busy sewing my new invention the Gee Keeper, as no where in Walla Walla sold the crib tent ( I&apos;ll have Jack take pictures for me later when its on her pac-n-play-  we had a leaky diaper incident and her sheets are in the dryer.&quot;  Anyway I was busy sewing when Jack hollered that it was snowing.  When I came down we took Megan out and Sadie out and enjoyed the snow for a few minutes... but before we made it in it had turned to Rain.  Still Megan has now officially seen her first &quot;s-no&quot;!
