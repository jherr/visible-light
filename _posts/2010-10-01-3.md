 [Something must be done](http://www.youtube.com/ellen#p/u/13/Br7nbQSIyhg)   this really struck a chord with me.  I was bullied a fair bit in school- for my weight, my skin - because I was such an easy target.  It wasn&apos;t until College that I was able to assert my own self and feel confident in my own skin.  I am so fearful for all kids as words and teasing do become so painful.
