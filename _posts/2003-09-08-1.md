So I&apos;m sitting at a red light and this guy in the corvette ahead of me throws a cig butt in the street.  I got mad, what can I do with out risking getting shot at, so I took out the digital camera and took a picture of his car.  All the way home I&quot;m thinking about it and wonder if other people are as annoyed with litterbugs as I am so I&apos;m wondering if people out there would post pictures to a website that is all about exposeing litterbugs?

what do you think ??? am I just being crazy?
