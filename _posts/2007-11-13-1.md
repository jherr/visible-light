Megan has started Ice skating Lessons.  She was scared to go but once the skates were on she was so excited and she loved it.  When she got off the ice, after 45 minutes of total concentration, she was yawning and slept well that night.  Not the best pics but here&apos;s two I clicked with my iphone through very scratched up plexi glass.
