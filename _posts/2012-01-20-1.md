One of the amazing things I get to do as a mom, is teach Art at Megan&apos;s school.  I teach each year in her class.   This started in first grade and has been on going.  We do 6 one and a half hour lessons, complete with a Art History Lesson, followed by a hands on project.  

I&apos;ve been aware of up coming project each year because other people are doing them ahead of me.  And everything seemed fun, except - plaster Masks.  We do these now in forth grade.  So since first grade I&apos;ve been dreading the idea of letting 32 forth graders making masks on each other.  Its probably because the thought of any of them touching me makes me shutter (wash those hands!)

So here we are forth grade ... and guess what I did today.

It went really well.  My fears where unfounded.  the kids for the most part were great.  I did have one little girl who decided to make balls with each piece of cast material and i had to redo her mask.  but ... now I can rest.  32 masks done.<br />
