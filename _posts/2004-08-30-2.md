both toilets are now out, and the supervisor is on his way.  no sewer vent on roof.  can&apos;t find the line in the yard, despite the marking on the street, and sending the largest snake you&apos;ve ever seen down one toilet hole has it coming up the other.  Megan, bless her is sleeping through &quot;the MACHINE&quot; and Jack has just made a pot of coffee.  I don&apos;t drink anything for fear I&apos;ll need to pee .. or worse.  So far no neighbors have awoken to see what the hell we are up to.  

Oh and Sadie is due at the vet by 8 am. for a round of tests, she&apos;s currently freezing her recently shaved butt off in the yard (pictures of the new do I&apos;m sure are coming soon)
