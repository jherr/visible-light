I get the pro-life side of it.  I personally would never choose an abortion, but I feel its a decision for a woman and her doctor.  In other countries its a non issue because its a medical decision.  but I get the arguments and the sides.  

What I&apos;m not getting - completely failing to understand is why anyone is against contraception and making it easily available.   If everyone used contraception who didn&apos;t want to have children - <strong>abortion would be a non-issue</strong>.  If people were educated on contraception they would never seek abortion providers.  It seems logical to me sex isn&apos;t used just for procreation - people do it in all times of life, and if you want to prevent unwanted pregnancies that you should be making contraception more accessible not less.

The last few weeks have been mind boggling to me... and yesterdays comment by Rick Santorium&apos;s main donor about &quot;in my day birth control was an aspirin between your knees&quot; feels like 1800&apos;s not the 2000&apos;s.  The panel of religious men with out a Uterus among them telling a Republican led congressional panel that suppling contraception to employees is  against Religious Freedom well - the old adage - if your not mad your not paying attention comes to mind.    

off my soap box... for now
