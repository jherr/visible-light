Today has been a nice Lazy day... One trip to Walmart for diapers and other incidentals and Megan is now down for a nap.  We had an easy lunch. 

Megan is loving her cousins so much.  She follows the two big boys around doing what ever they do and loves to chase them and hunt for them.  

She really missed them today while they were at School, but they will be back when she wakes up.

I&apos;m off to Nap as soon as Gee is asleep and I can safely creep into bed.
