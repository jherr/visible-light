Megan and I read a book every night that has the song  [Teddy Bear Teddy bear](http://www.coe.iup.edu/worldofkindergarten/B/bearso.html)  in it.  So each night we do what the Teddy Bear does.  Megan&apos;s favorite part is to scream wake up at me when I pretend to sleep.  

Yesterday at art class we did this little finger play thing with the teacher where the fingers go to sleep and she started yelling &quot;wake up&quot;  and &quot;wake up now&quot;  everyone laughed and thought it was funny and after class I apologized to the teacher with a chuckle and explained where it was coming from.  Well...

this morning I&apos;m laying in bed and Megan wakes up.  She usually plays quietly in her crib while I get moving.  this morning though I heard a giggle over the monitor and then she said &quot;wake up&quot;  then louder and louder until she was screaming it and throwing in a couple of mommy&apos;s.  I while laughing my butt off decided to &quot;ignore&quot; the demands and wait till she&apos;s quieted down before going in and starting the day.
