Megan and I started an art class yesterday.  She had a blast going from painting to playdough and then on to gluing and coloring.  It is taught by teacher Linda the same nice lady that taught us art camp earlier in the summer.   The class is alittle more diverse and the parents didn&apos;t seem to want to talk to each other, but maybe after a few classes people will follow my lead and chat.  Till then I have one other mom to talk to who is also in our gym class on mondays.
