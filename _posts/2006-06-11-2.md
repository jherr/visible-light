I had my film club today - let me first tell you that I got an email from the clubs director informing me that San Jose was having a gay pride parade and parking would be scarce - so arrive early.  I drove down at 11:30 - show time is 2.  I got down by noon and well the parade was long over and everything was cleaned up.  Downtown seemed almost diserted. Since i&apos;d had a big breakfast with Jack and Megan this morning, I wasn&apos;t really in the mood for lunch.  I decided to just walk around Down Town San Jose.  First I found a drug store and managed to waste alittle time there.  Then walking further I found the  [San Jose Museum of Art](http://www.sjmusart.org/) .   Well still having over an hour and half to kill I decided to wonder on in.  I really enjoyed myself.  Though I can honestly say i&apos;m not a hugh fan of &quot;modern&quot; art, I did enjoy seeing all the different pieces.  And I took my time, figuring I could come back next film club if I didn&apos;t see it all, but as it turned out the museum is small and I did.

On To Film Club...

Today&apos;s movie was  [Richard Schiff ](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0771493/) its a hot button film that will have you cringing and still walking away thinking.  It&apos;s a film that will stick with you.  Not sure when it will open as they haven&apos;t found a distributor for it yet.

After the film we were lucky enough to enjoy a question and answer session with Peter Krause.  He did tell us they still had a bit of editing they wished to do, and he clarified or rather explained the purpose of one aspect of the ending which I found a little clichÃ© before his explanation.  It was a rare treat to get to talk with an actor I so dearly enjoy the work of.   I suspect he will always be  [ Nate Fisher ](http://www.hbo.com/sixfeetunder/) for me.

I came home to a lovely home made dinner by Jack and a cuddly Megan who is fighting a cold.
All in all, not a bad way to spend a day.
