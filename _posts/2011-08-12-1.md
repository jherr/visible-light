Back from a great trip to Florida.  happy to be home though - missed the puppies and Jack, oh and my electric toothbrush.

School starts at the end of the month and Megan begins forth grade.  Jack will be heading back east.   To visit his brother and family as well as see his Dad who has moved in with his brother.  He has been diagnosed with  late stage Alzheimer&apos;s.  

For now we are just going to enjoy the end of summer.  A trip to Santa Cruz, hanging with friends, a few art projects.  Jack is building a cabinet to house the components for under the tv in the family room.
