In the morning Megan and I are heading out on our latest adventure.  We are heading up to Klamath Falls the first night and then over to Crater Lake the next day.  We&apos;ll be there till Saturday when we head south to Mt Lassen National Park but will stop at Lava Beds National Monument on the way.   I&apos;ll have wifi probably the first night and then after crater lake. but the 3 days in crater lake will be in a virtual black out zone - will have to remember how to call collect on pay phones again.

The car is mostly packed, with camping equipment, as we are cabin camping in Lassen.  We are bringing art supplies and the small telescope so the car will be full for the adventure.   Megan&apos;s height allows her now to sit in the front seat so the back seats are folded down in order to pack more stuff in. I&apos;ll update as we go when I can, and pictures when I can - no iphone means no easy pictures.<br />
