As Jack mentioned in his log, I did go and see this bomb last night, and really with everyone saying it was terrible, it really wasn&apos;t that bad, but then when you expect the worst, its amazing how things don&apos;t seem that bad.

I don&apos;t recommend it, I didn&apos;t buy the story line and well, it was a fun night out with a friend, and while it was better than show girls - it was still a bad movie.
