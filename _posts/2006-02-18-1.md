Listening to NPR today on the way to Target and had to wait in the car to finish listening to this story.   [Charmaine Neville](http://soundprint.org/radio/display_show/ID/682/name/After+Katrina:+Charmaine+Neville&apos;s+Story) , a jazz singer and sister to the Neville brothers was in the 9th ward during Katrina and this interview is gripping.  What they endured - and in the United States the most powerful nation in the world is unimaginable.
