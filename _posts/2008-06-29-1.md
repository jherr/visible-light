I was responding to a friends blog who was lamenting that she didn&apos;t love her dog .. It got me thinking about why dogs are such a part of my life. 

Honestly I think your either a dog person your or not- if your not then  you might have one special one that makes you think you are but that won&apos;t make you love the species and there isn&apos;t anything really you can do.  You don&apos;t have to love your dog, but you should appreciate the value they have for your kids and the family as a whole.  

There is this notion that people need dogs out of loneliness and need a loyal, unconditional  friend.   I adore all dogs and haven&apos;t meet one yet I couldn&apos;t easily fall in love with. But I&apos;m certainly not lonely. 

 I&apos;ve had some very special favorites like Ripley - our first dog after we moved back from Australia, but I really love both my boys now and can&apos;t imagine having a house without having dogs too.  We bought this house for the yard - for the dogs we&apos;d have in the future.  We put a bay window in the living room so the dogs could have a look out.  When ever I imagine the future I see a house full of dogs.
