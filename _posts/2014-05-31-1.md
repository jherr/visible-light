I&apos;ve been seeing a whole lot of doctors lately.  Some for actual issues and some for check ups.  There has been good news and great news.  No real bad news but a few issues that need work, like I was diagnosed with RLS (Restless Leg Syndrome)- which I always thought was a made up disease by the pharmaceutical companies - turns out its real - I know now because I have it.

But the best news is my basic blood work.  For the first time in my adult life - my cholesterol is normal.  And better still - by good cholesterol and bad cholesterol levels are where they should be - no more concern or worry by my doctors.  

And I know - I owe it all to walking - the 7 or so miles I try to walk a day - have really started to pay off.  I&apos;ve lost a little weight but more I&apos;ve lost several clothing sizes and am able to shop in stores that only go up to 16.  I&apos;m not where i want to be yet - and I still want to walk up Mission Peak - but I&apos;m getting there and I feel great.<br />
