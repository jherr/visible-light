IT was a great weekend.  We all went camping with friends to  [Big Basin](http://www.bigbasin.org/camping.html) .  It is a lovely park, lots of redwoods and chipmunks.  But also HOT and lots of mosquitos - an unbelievable amount!  Megan was eaten alive - now wearing a badge of 25+ bite marks.  

Saturday was Jack&apos;s birthday and we celebrated with presents and  [Kinder&apos;s Ball TIp steak on the grill. ](http://www.kindersbbq.com/)  

We returned and Monday I spent the day cleaning and doing laundry.   Today we are zoo bound.
