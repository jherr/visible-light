6 years ago today my mom died.  Saying that out load still puts a catch in my throat.  I miss her so overwhelmingly sometimes.  Now that I have Megan, I want to talk to her again, to share with her, and ask her questions.  But sometimes really is just a hug - to have and give a big hug.  Mom was great for hugs.  They meant so much, only at the time I thought I&apos;d have them for a long long time.  What I would give for one of her hugs.

I tried to donate blood today in her honor, but I&apos;m anemic and they didn&apos;t want my blood, try again in a week they said.

To bring the mood down even more, I think Sadie is taking a turn for the worse.  She peed all over the sofa today in her sleep,  and her urine glucose has been very wacky, and very low.  She had been staying moderate to high, but while we were away her numbers sunk low and there they&apos;ve stayed.
The goal now is keeping her comfortable, and preparing Megan who is absolutely in love with &quot;her dog&quot; Sadie.
