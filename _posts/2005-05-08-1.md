This park was gorgeous, exactly what I imagined sleeping in the redwoods would be like.  They were tall and majestic, the air was moist and clean. Behind our campsite was a stream that Megan and Josephine enjoyed &quot;fishing&quot; in.  We had a fire in the fire pit, and roasted boca sausages, and had baked beans and corn, The night was freezing, and Megan refused to be covered up but as it was 49 degrees in the tent so i figured she needed covering.  I kept throwing blankets and my sleeping bag on her.  So needless to say it was a sleepless night for both of us. I awoke in the morning to Megan staring into my face saying &quot;Hi Mommy&quot;.  Jack arrived in time for pancakes in the morning, and then he entertained the kids while we broke camp.  It really was a wonderful time, but I was also very thankful it was only one night.  We both slept well last night.

For mother&apos;s day we planned on my sleeping in, while Jack and Megan got bagels, then we were going to go boating on the bay but ended up just hanging out at home because of the weather.  We did a bit of cleaning, organizing and earthquake proofing.  Megan&apos;s now napping and afterwards I think we&apos;ll go out for some Mexican for dinner.
