Labor day weekend we are doing the 5K at Disneyland.  Jack is also doing the half marathon.  So I&apos;m working up to it.  

Today I did a mile and half, plus walking to the park and back.  I think I&apos;ll be ok for 3 miles come Sept.  Course I&apos;m not running but walking quickly.  Hopefully I won&apos;t be one of those people that gets pulled off the course for going to slow.  Must work on that .
