Busy day yesterday.  We met Yvonne and Josephine at  [Coyote Point Museum](http://www.coyoteptmuseum.org/)  in San Mateo.  We had a lovely time.  Megan really enjoyed watching the bumble bees and the otter, as well as looking at all the gingerbread houses that were on exhibit.

We had a walk around the point before heading to Foster City for lunch.  Today we are going shopping and then heading over to see Stefan and give him his present before he heads to San Diego for xmas.

my back is feeling much better.  All the heat has helped.
