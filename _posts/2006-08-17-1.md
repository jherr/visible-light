Wednesday Megan and really had a full day together.  First we headed down to the  [The Container Store](http://www.containerstore.com/)  for really my entertainment.  We got a new shampoo holder for Megan&apos;s bathroom, along with some under the bed storage boxes, and some neat little gadgets.  

We then headed over to  [Children&apos;s Discovery Museum](http://www.cdm.org/index.asp?f=1)  and had a blast playing in all the rooms.  My only complaint was that the woman who did story time was quiet and timid and didn&apos;t hold any of the kids attention for very long.  After lunch at the cafe we played some more in the bubble room and the water room, before heading out and back north.  Passing Thorton Ave I saw that the temp was 76 thanks to the Chevy dealerships sign so we headed over to the pool for a swim.  It was a bit cooler than 76 by the time we finished swimming an hour or so later.  

Once home, Jack made us a lovely dinner, and then Megan and Jack went on a bike ride while I relaxed.    Both of us slept well last night - though I did stay up way to late playing Lemmings on the PSP.
