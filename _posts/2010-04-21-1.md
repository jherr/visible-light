Jack drove down early in the morning and surprised Megan.  After a lovely breakfast at our B&B we checked out and  walked down to the Aquarium.    We had fun running around - starting at the opposite end that we usual start at, and ending in the Green exhibit (That caused me to come home and unplug our microwave).  

We left well before lunch and headed back to down town Pacific Grove. Well the town had a street fair going on - called &quot;Olden Days&quot;  we wondered through the booths and then found a great cafe for lunch, before heading over to where Megan could ride some kid rides.

At this point I headed back to the car and Jack and Megan headed down to the beach to wonder around in the tide pools.  

I headed home.  Megan and Jack followed covered in sand about an hour later.  It was good to have that time with the dogs, and to start the laundry.
