We got season passes to  [Great America](http://www.pgathrills.com/)  to keep us busy this summer.  So last friday we met some friends there and had a great time.

here&apos; are the pics from our first visit - i&apos;m sure more are coming as we&apos;ll be going weekly.

After the water park area we dried off and headed to the rides.  Megan and Bryce rode this coaster 4 times!
