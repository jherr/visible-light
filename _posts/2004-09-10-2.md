What a wickedly tense game.  16-10 and I thought for sure we were going to get our *&%^% served back to us on a silver planter.  Gore rocked in OT glad he&apos;s back and in good health.  Berlin was great and so was our DEFENSE!  Wish they hadn&apos;t cut it quite so close, I don&apos;t think Jack could have taken any more.
