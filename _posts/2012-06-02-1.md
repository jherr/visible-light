Today was really a glorious day.  We drove up to Brentwood which is a farming town about an hour north east of here.  We first pulled into a farm that had Peaches, Nectarines, and apricots advertised, but it turned out only the peaches were ripe and so we picked 2 buckets of those.  Then we drove down the road to a cherry farm and filled a big bucket.  

Lunch in brentwood, and on the drive home we swung through Livermore to our favorite winery - http://www.rubyhillwinery.net/  and enjoyed some yummy wine tasting before purchasing some wine to enjoy at home.  

Once home, we pitted and froze enough cherries for 2 pies come thanksgiving.  And there will be Peach cobbler for dessert.
