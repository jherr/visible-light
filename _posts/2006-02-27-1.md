The storm of the season is upon us.  Wind blowing strong, lots of rain.  Kind of makes me want to just stay home, which for the most part we will, though we&apos;re running out of milk so a trip to the grocery store will have to happen.

All these weather fluctuations, have meant the dogs don&apos;t know whether to shed or not-  and both have decided to shed and grown new hair.  Which means i&apos;ve been vacuuming almost every day.  Thank goodness I still love my dyson ;)

Jack and I braved the weather last night to have dinner and a movie out.  Had we not already booked the sitter, I would have opted for staying home and having a fire in the fireplace.  We tried a new mexican restaurant called  [Blue Agave](http://www.blueagaveclub.com/blueagave.html) that has taken over a nice little treasure in Fremont called Pearls.   We&apos;ve taken many guests to the original spot including Mel,  Mom and Carlos on their last visit. Jack even had the original restaurant cater my 30th birthday party.  And as we ate last night we reminisced about at least 2 anniversaries we&apos;ve spent there.

The have worked hard to keep some of Pearls flavor.  And the food was delicious, though very pricey for Mexican.  Its authentic and not tex-Mex, which is a nice change and reminded us of  [Mexicali Rose in Australia](http://www.mexicalirose.com.au/)  and Peppers Mexicali Cafe in Pacific Grove, California (no website found).  We&apos;ll probably go back for special occasions but at 50 bucks a head easy - we won&apos;t go often.

After dinner we we to an older theater, with small seats and no stadium seating, and saw  [Eight Below](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/eight_below/) .  I enjoyed the movie, and I cried but I was annoyed that the dogs were put in that position anyway - I know they are working dogs, but still sleeping outside! - when Oso sleeps on my bed (under the covers!)  and tied up as their humans fly away!  Jack said it was probably so they wouldn&apos;t run after the plane or get on the runway - but still!  All in all a good movie - deserving of the Fresh rating its getting on Rotten Tomatoes.  But dog lovers beware (especially if you&apos;ve lost a close friend) - you will cry - there is no way to see it and not.
