Don&apos;t leave Oso alone in the kitchen - he gets stuck on the rug and can&apos;t seem to break free - and i&apos;m not even joking ...

Poor guy seems to be having issues (either nurological or eye sight related) but basically he gets himself on the rug of the kitchen and day or night ends up freaking out until someone comes talks him out of the corner (or shows him the way out).  

About 5 mins ago Jack came out of the office and went in the kitchen for an apple.  Oso followed him in and didn&apos;t follow him out- Jack returned to the office and next thing I know I hear his nails hitting the floor and then him backing up on the rug  - We&apos;ve been joking that its like Lava is on the floor, but really it seems more serious, and its a new behavior for an already strange dog.   

A week ago he walked into a box  that was in the kitchen.  He backed up surprised by it, and then walked into it again.  He then didn&apos;t trust himself to walk forward and started whining - That&apos;s when I figured he must be going blind in his old age.

Let see - 7 years for one of ours - and he&apos;s about 9 that makes him only 63.  But you have to add a few years for all the anxiety, and a few more for getting hit by a car when he was a year old.  But still that&apos;s not that old.  So who knows-  I take him to the vet on thursday - I will probably be told I&apos;m crazy.
