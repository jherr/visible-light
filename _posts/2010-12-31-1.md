Time for resolutions.  I&apos;m keeping it easy this year.  I&apos;m going to resolve to be better at correspondence, to send cards and notes to people through snail mail as much as possible.  I love the internet, but we are loosing the art of letter writing, and personal touches.  This year - I&apos;m going to bring it back - so if your birthday is in January and probably February - you&apos;re in luck - beyond that I slack off again. 

Our new year is going to be an exciting one.  We are closing on a new house January 15th and will be moving soon after.  Our current abode will be going on the market around then too so if you need a house in Union City - we&apos;ll have one for sale shortly.  We&apos;ve held off talking about the whole thing but we started this process in September and have been dealing with setback after setback.  At times we never thought it was going to go through.  

My other news is I find myself a contributor for a website on Local news.  My first  [article is here.](http://unioncity.patch.com/articles/keep-it-clean-union-city)   I&apos;m very excited by this.  And hope to have future articles accepted as well.
