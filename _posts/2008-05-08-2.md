Megan is learning the  [Valicha dance ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jaPCH8ndnc) from a mom at school.  We have a multi-cultural feast coming up and this mom from Peru wanted her son to perform but he needed a partner.  Megan enthusiastically volunteered, and its been fun watching her learn all the steps.  Her version is a bit simpler then the one on the video above. 

Anyway - here she is in costume which she tried on the other day.  Monday she and the boy will try out for the show .. .I&apos;ll keep you posted.
