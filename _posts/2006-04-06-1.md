the sun is shining finally, though another storm is on its way.  The lawn man went ahead and mowed the back yard yesterday despite the standing water.  He assured me it was ok and that he&apos;d rather mow it now then wait for it grow even taller and try in 2 weeks.    So Megan and I can play out back after school, because the grass is shorter, and hopefully the sun will dry us out a bit, but that is what rubber boots are for.

I read last night that our pool opens next week - which surprises the heck out of me cause we haven&apos;t made it out of the 60&apos;s yet.  Actually on the rainy days which has been ever day for the last week we&apos;ve been in the 50&apos;s.  Can&apos;t imagine anyone actually going to the pool.
