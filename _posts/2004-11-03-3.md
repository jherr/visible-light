A little while ago Megan handed me the phone and said &quot;Hi Daddy&quot; I agreed with her and put the phone down, she picked it up again and was even more insistent  Gogo Daddy Hi Daddy.  I said OK... and we called Jack and I handed her the phone and she happy told him hi daddy.  She really is a light for us.  And a reason to go on fighting.

Now as she naps, I crawl back into bed myself.  Because there is no place better to be than under a down comforter on a cold rainy day when you feel depressed.
