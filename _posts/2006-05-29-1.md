Megan loves McDonald&apos;s Pancakes.  Today she even asked for them specifically.  Since we aren&apos;t rushing anywhere there is no need to resort to McD&apos;s for breakfast so I said no, but then I did a google search to find  [the McDonald Pancake Recipe](http://www.recipezaar.com/1633)  its no wonder she likes them over all others - just look at all that sugar! - why am I not surprised.
