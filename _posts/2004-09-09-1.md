Megan had a tumble yesterday and lost most of one fingernail.  I can handle most anything... but I can&apos; no longer look at her poor hand.  Hopefully it won&apos;t gross me out of long. 

I too woke up in the middle of the night - around 2.  I got up and watched Amish in the City (which I&apos;d tivo&apos;d)  yes I like bad TV.  I surfed the web and then an hour later went back to bed.

So what to do with a girl with a cold who wants to go out and play... but really shouldn&apos;t.  Our back yard is OK, but hot!  I think I&apos;m going to introduce her to a new movie this afternoon.
