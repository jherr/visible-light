my moniter is acting up - I can&apos;t see anything on it unless I have it at less than a 90 degree angle.  it seems to like 80 degrees best which means i have to hold the whole laptop kind of on its back so I can see it all.

Megan and I will be taking a trip to the apple store today and I guess a walk around Palo Alto.
