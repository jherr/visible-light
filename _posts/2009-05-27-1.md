I received a phone call yesterday from the brother of the woman I saw last week on the bridge.  He found my blog probably because of google. It was such a touching message on our answering machine.  He very carefully said nothing which I am grateful for - Megan being in the room when I pressed play.

 I still don&apos;t even know her name and yet I feel more at peace with the tragedy.  Somehow, even though I know what I witnessed, I&apos;ve had moments of just doubt - how could I have seen what I saw.  Moments this past week were I felt like I had made the whole thing up and so I would concentrate on the details, and then all the emotion would come flooding back.    While his message to me made it all real again, it also reassured me.  

Anyway - Thank you her dear brother for your call, for reaching out to me a total stranger.  You were able to look past your own pain and you saw mine.  I am so incredibly sorry for your loss - and for the pain your family is going through.  My thoughts are with you all.
