Before Maui I bought the latest Patricia Cornwell novel about Dr  Scarpetta a forensic pathologies.  I&apos;ve loved the previous books though like all serials the stories have gotten unrealistic and the characters a bit ridiculous.  Anyway this story so far has dealt with a bunch of other character with on indirect chapter about Dr Scarpetta and one actually from her point of view - I think i&quot;m on Chapter 28.  What it has been good for is putting me to sleep.  It&apos;s really been making me snooze.
