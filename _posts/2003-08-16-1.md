I think that is the proper spelling for the movie I saw today.  It wasn&apos;t bad, pretty good actually, but I think its being pushed as the next &quot;Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot; and well it wasn&apos;t that good.  

Just found an Australian movie where Russell Crow plays a gay man, older movie before Gladiator for sure.  Too funny.  He does a pretty believable job.
