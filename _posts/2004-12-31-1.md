Jack and I have only spent the last week looking for a dog so maybe things will get easier.  But I keep finding dogs that the humane societies dont think we should adopt because of Sadie, or they get adopted just after we look at them (kind of like house hunting in the bay area).  There are lots of Pitt Mixes in The bay area but Jack and I dont want to get another pitt so soon after Ripley.  Maybe when Megan is much older we&apos;ll get another one, but not now.  So we&apos;lre looking for something else.  

I spent time looking at Petfinder this morning and ever dog in one shelter had a note saying the dog should goto a home with a child 12 or older.  Its very discouraging.  We know we&apos;re a great home for dogs but there aren&apos;t many choices for us... yet I know tons need to be rescued.d
