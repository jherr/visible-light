Our Mattress is old and my back can&apos;t take it anymore.  Any suggestions on a good mattress that would work with our slat bed (no box springs) would be greatly appreciated. I&apos;ve been dragging my feet about shopping for one (til after my trip next week to Florida) and my back is paying for it.
