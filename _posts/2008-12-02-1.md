I&apos;ve been of the opinion lately that Evangelicals had nothing to offer us.  I see nothing but negative impacts from their teachings and it was starting to skew my opinion of all religious folks.  This bothered me tremendously because I&apos;ve always prided myself on being open and as accepting as possible.  But between the current administration of our country and people like James Dobson and Sarah Palin, I was definately struggling to remain open minded.

Today on the radio I heard a part of the show <a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=13&quot;>Fresh Air. <a>  I will download it so that I can hear the rest, but on it was Conservative Christian Richard Cizik, a lobbyist in Washington  He said things like ... When you look at Gods Creation you have to become an environmentalist - if your not its like your a fan of Shakespeare but you burn all his scripts. ... and he discussed gay marriages he said that evangelicals need to worry about fixing heterosexual marriages and stop worrying so much about gay marriage.  While he isn&apos;t entirely for the idea of gay marriage it was certainly the most open minded thing i&apos;ve ever heard from an evangelical.  

Of course convincing people is his job but it was a breath of .... wait for it .... &quot;Fresh Air!&quot;
