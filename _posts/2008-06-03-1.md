I snuck off to see Sex and the City today - my last movie of the school year.  I really enjoyed it.  I was a hugh fan of the show, and the movie really captured the spirit of it.  It was long, and non-fans will be bored.  For those who never saw the show on HBO and only became a fan when it stream lined to regular channels, you may be a little shocked - but not much.  I remember at least one episode of show that was more risque then the movie.
