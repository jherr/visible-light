Now I can say a movie I saw was not so great.  Stuck on you had its moments and seeing Cher and Meryle Streep laugh at themselves is great, but overall its really just not that great of a movie.

The lines for LOTR:Return of the King were insane.  And these people had already bought tickets, they were just waiting an hour+ for seating.
