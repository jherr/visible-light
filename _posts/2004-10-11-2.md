I went with another mom friend of mine to a movie tonight and saw  [Diarios de motocicleta]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318462/) .  It is the early story of Che Guevara, when he was still a medical student, and how he took a trip around South America with his best friend.  It was beautifully filmed, and the stark contrasts of overwhelming poverty with beautiful scenery is shown as the changing point for how this student became a revolutionary.  It doesn&apos;t become overwhelmed with politics, it just tells a  story beautifully.
