New year new resolutions - yada yada yada!

I swam yesterday but its cold here - 35 this morning when I got Megan out the door, so I decided I&apos;d dust off the Wii Fit and use it this morning.  I broke out into a sweat and my muscles are sore - all that from a video game!

Back to the pool thursday but its nice to have another option.
