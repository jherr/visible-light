I got my hair trimmed today.  I noticed my hair dresser who i&apos;ve been using for the past 5 years seemed a little sad, and it turns out her mother died recently and unexpectedly.  Her mother helped her out in her shop and so I did know her a little as well.  I really feel for her - loosing my mom really effected me - still does to this day.  I can&apos;t tell you  how many times I&apos;ve wanted to talk to her in the last 10 years. Seeing someone else going through it and being in such a raw state, what can I say - puts it all back into perspective.  Hold onto those you love dear ones....
