I&apos;m not one for war movies usually.  The lack of females, the ultra violence - it just doesn&apos;t speak to me.  But I understand their place in telling history, and some Like &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; stay with me long after I saw them.

Film club sunday screened  [Indigenes](http://www.filmsdistribution.com/film.php?id=2)  which has been renamed &quot;Day&apos;s Of Glory&quot; For its American release.  Its a french film about African soldiers who came to France&apos;s call and fought against the germans during WW1, and yet they were marginalized and treated unfairly.  Its a very moving piece, incredibly well made.  

Apparently when Jacque Chirac viewed the movie with his wife, she leaked to the press that he&apos;d better do something about the pensions for the foreign soldiers, and he did, ordering pensions paid to foreign french fighters equal that of native french military.  It&apos;s costing the french government millions.   This all happened when the film opened in France so its been a big hit there.  Unfortunately unless it wins the oscar for best foreign film, it&apos;ll only ever be seen in limited release here.  

I recommend it.  Its not a light film, but its thought provoking and deeply moving.
