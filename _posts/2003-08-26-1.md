Megan and I have been so busy today.  We left early to meet Pam and Josephine at Hillsdale Mall in San Mateo, we had a early lunch at Maccaroni Grill and then went to Organized Living - the best store for all that neat organization stuff that you wonder where to buy.

We then headed back across the bay  (while Megan napped) to Gymboree where she got very annoyed with me for moving her from activity to activity - she just wanted to stick with one and keep doing it over and over again.  She&apos;s enjoying standing up and can crawler/wggle to get to a destitnation.

Now were home for another nap, and then we will meet Jack at the car mechanic where we are dropping off his car for 10,000 mile check up  and then have dinner out.
