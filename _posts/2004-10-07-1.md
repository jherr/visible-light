I used to be a Republican.  I voted for Bush Sr in 1992.  I never voted for Clinton, because I just didn&apos;t trust him. But I realize now after 4 years of Bush Jr that Clinton was a phenomenal president.  He as a flawed man.  I think he is the first to admit it.  He suffered his own weaknesses and gave material to the late night talk shows but he was good for America.
