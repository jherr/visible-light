I went to class today and well, I put in my first zipper.  I couldn&apos;t be prouder.  I did have it out when I failed to actually attach fabric to zipper all the way down.  My teacher had said sew close to the teeth and I took her to literal.  But after that I got it in and well was totally amazed with myself.  Now i&apos;m working on the sleeves.

The strips on all the front and back panels including the zipper lined up... but the one insult to injury after all the grief the strips gave me is the thread is really weak embroidery thread and not the right kind.  It looks good but may not wash well.  If the strips fall off... i&apos;m painting them back on!
