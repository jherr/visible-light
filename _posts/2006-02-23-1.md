When my mom was sick, while having different things done to her, she would hold my hand.  That was when I first started to hate my wedding band.  Jack and I had picked our bands out of a guys garage in Miami, actually he was a retired jeweler who still had alittle inventory to move.  We got great deals on 2 bands, Jack&apos;s was convex and mine was concave.  I figured it was neat that mine fit in his, even though they didn&apos;t match.  

Well cut to years later and i&apos;ve repeatedly had cuts on my hands from the ring, but it wasn&apos;t until Mom was sick, and said to me - why do you keep waring a ring that causes pain - and  that made me want a new ring.  

I&apos;ve tried different rings over time, but nothing really felt right so i&apos;d end up back with the concave one.  So I recently just started going with out - but this bugged me too.  Well today I went to Macy&apos;s 50% off jewelry sale and bought my self a beautiful solid gold band.  nothing fancy, but not painful either.  and so now I feel married again (ok not really - a ring doesn&apos;t make the marriage - but it sure helps).
