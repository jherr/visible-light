I DON&apos;T UNDERSTAND undecided voters - Are you asleep????

 [David Sedaris ](http://www.newyorker.com/humor/2008/10/27/081027sh_shouts_sedaris) says it best...

<i/>&quot;To put them in perspective, I think of being on an airplane. The flight attendant comes down the aisle with her food cart and, eventually, parks it beside my seat. â€œCan I interest you in the chicken?â€ she asks. â€œOr would you prefer the platter of shit with bits of broken glass in it?â€
To be undecided in this election is to pause for a moment and then ask how the chicken is cooked.&quot;

I DON&apos;T UNDERSTAND proposition 8.  Would someone please tell me how two people who love each other and get married but happen to be of the same sex hurt my marriage - why the hell does my marriage need to be protected?  

Legalized Gay Marriage doesn&apos;t mean churches must preform the marriage - Churches can still decide for themselves but it means marriage is available for all, and it means my friends don&apos;t have to get married again and again each time the law changes.   I know heterosexual people who have had bad marriages, divorced several times and yet still have the right to do it again and again, yet I know gay people who have been together for years  and years, and I&apos;m just sick that anyone would deny them any rights.  

Gay Marriage doesn&apos;t hurt anyone! 

I DON&apos;T UNDERSTAND Anyone voting for McCain at this moment in time.  He has just seemed so out of touch and the thought of Palin replacing him makes me absolutely shudder.

I DON&apos;T UNDERSTAND why Hillary keeps asking me for donations - I supported her but now that she&apos;s out she&apos;s out!  and I know she&apos;s in debt -but any money I donate now would goto Obama so that he can win!

I DON&apos;T UNDERSTAND anyone who doesn&apos;t realize now after 8 years of Bush, that we had it a hell of alot better under Clinton - Even with Lewinsky!

I DON&apos;T UNDERSTAND the continued games to keep people from voting - how stupid do they think we are?

I DON&apos;T UNDERSTAND CBS and ABC making CSI and Grey&apos;s last one minute longer so that ER won&apos;t record unless I do a manual record - Very annoying!


RANT OVER
