My film club screened  [Once](http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/once/) . 

This movie really struck a chord with me.  Its a movie about discovering your passion.  The songs are about healing, hurting, and living.  I really recommend this film.  I&apos;ve already downloaded all the music I could and have uploaded it to my IPOD - it&apos;ll be my music for a while.

UPDATE:  I&apos;m not alone in my admiration for this flick -  [Rottentomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/once/)  gives it a whopping 97% and the one lone negative review well he was just smoking crack.
