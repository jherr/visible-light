I&apos;m just going to say this.  I am happy.  I have a grin on my face most of the time these days.  and I think I owe it all to walking.  Jack gave me a fitbit for my birthday in December.  It counts steps, stairs, active minutes and calories burned.  I thought up until then that I was walking a ton and getting healthy - but then I could barely do 10,000 steps, so my twice daily dog walks where cutting it.  

By mid January I had set my goal at 12,000 steps.  Pretty soon I just wanted to reach 100,000 for 7 days.  Now I try to keep from falling below 100,000 in a 7 day period and so I&apos;m at about 17,000 steps a day.  And I&apos;m starting to feel amazing.  I&apos;m not as achy as I was, all my clothing is loose. 

But the best part is I&apos;m happy - my mood is light and airy.  I feel amazing.  And I actually want to shout it from roof tops.  

Jack and I have started taking walks together when ever we can.  And the dogs, no longer want to walk as much as I do - and I dutifully bring them home before heading back out myself.  

So if tomorrow I wake up sad - I&apos;m going to come down and delete this post and stop sharing. - I don&apos;t want to Jinx myself.<br />
