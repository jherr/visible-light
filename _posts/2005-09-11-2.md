I was vacuuming the kitchen earlier and a fly was buzzing all around.  So I took out the wand from the  [Dyson](http://www.dyson.com)  and cornered it and the sucked it up.  When I emptied the Dyson later I saw the fly body sans wings.

Sadie was our fly catcher before she went blind.. now its Dyson.
