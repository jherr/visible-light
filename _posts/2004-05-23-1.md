Ripley is currently at the local animal emergency hospital.  She couldn&apos;t get up this am, after a couple of days of what seemed like an upset stomach.  We are at a loss.  Her liver enzymes are really high and she is in alot of pain.  We are so worried about her.
Jack is to pick her up in the morning and take her over to our vet. We&apos;ll keep you posted.
