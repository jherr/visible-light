<br />well will you look at that - I still have a blog - 

We&apos;ve moved north - to Oregon.  We live in a wooded hill called Spring Mountain - where coyote and deer are our neighbors. 

If any one even checks this page maybe I&apos;ll go back to writing here - since I&apos;ve cut way back on facebook. Facebook which became a hot mess of politics and name calling.  I obsessed and checked it hourly and found my calm disappearing.  So after the election were we ended up with the orange orangoutang I deleted it from my phone - Still checking it occasionally from my laptop but only once a day at most.  Some days I&apos;m in bed almost asleep when I realize Ive missed a whole day and i&apos;m so pleased with that.  I can still post pictures and share what I&apos;m doing but with out even logging into it on my phone.  This all makes me happy - Calm restored.
