We made a roast chicken last night, It was really delicious but really really complicated.  I&apos;ll try again with a few less steps. 

Basically we brined the bird then used a rosemary and garlic rub.   We roasted it at a high temp for 30 mins, then lowered it for another 30.  The chicken was tasty and moist - really really good.  But I think we could have accomplished the same thing at a lower temp with out smoking out the house.  Also the Au Jus on the side would have made a great gravy if i&apos;d thickened it, so i&apos;ll do that next time too.
