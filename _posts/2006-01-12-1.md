I honestly didn&apos;t mind Alito until this morning.  Until now I thought he was probably the best we could hope for but after reading this  [lovely gem in his own words](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2006/01/11/click-here-to-read-the-po_n_13659.html) 

&quot;People nowadays just don&apos;t seem to know their place. Everywhere one turns black and hispanics are demanding jobs simply because they&apos;re black and hispanic, the physically handicapped are trying to gain equal representation in professional sports, and homosexuals are demanding that government vouchsafe them the right to bear children. And now... and now come women.&quot;

I&apos;ve reconsidered. I don&apos;t want Alito anymore.
