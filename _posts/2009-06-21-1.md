We did basically nothing last night - everyone too exhausted to really move, but today I busted a move.  I Vacuumed up a weeks worth of dog hair, did a weeks worth of laundry, mowed the back, got groceries and fresh produce.  

Then while getting a chicken in the oven I broke our kitchen faucet.  Snapped it in two basically so Jack gets to spend the evening replacing it.
