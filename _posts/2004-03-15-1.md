So I woke up this morning to the sounds of Megan just beginning to wake.  I looked at the clock 8:30am.  I rolled out of bed took a shower, got dressed and started coffee, and a load of laundry.  Megan was really awake now so I went in and got her all dressed figuring it was about 9. We came out to the living room and started nursing, I flipped on the TV and - its only 7:30 - Jack&apos;s alarm clock is wrong and its much earlier than I thought.  I guess I should be happy to have  an extra hour this morning, but somehow I&apos;m feeling gipped.  I thought I had gotten to sleep in alittle.
