Always read the label!  I just spent an hour cutting and labeling fabric for Megan&apos;s costume, and I labeled it all with what I thought was a water erasable pen.  But I noticed as I stacked it in the end I saw no markings on the first peices ... because...

I was using an air erasable pen!  

Damn that - I didn&apos;t even know they made those let alone sell them to poor unsuspecting non-label readers like me!
