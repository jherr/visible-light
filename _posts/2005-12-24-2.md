UPDATE:  we ended up with 2 get togethers.  First Winsha came over and brought gifts and hung out with us for a while.  Then an hour after she left Pam and Yvonne came over with Josephine, and we had wine and cheese and the girls opened gifts.  Then the girls rough housed, followed by another viewing of  [Rudolf the red nose reindeer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058536/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9cnVkb2xmIHRoZSByZWQgbm9zZSB8ZnQ9MXxteD0yMHxsbT01MDB8Y289MXxodG1sPTF8bm09MQ__;fc=1;ft=21;fm=1)  classic.  The girls had some pasta and the we shared some take out chinese.  Then they were off and Megan and I set out cookies and carrots for Santa and the crew, we also sprinkled some reindeer food thanks to Gee&apos;s school in the yard (1 cup of oatmeal to 1/2 cup glitter) in the yard.  I&apos;m sure the mice will love that!

Megan&apos;s now in the bath then we&apos;ll have a reading of the night before Christmas.

OH the high light is tivoing the Yule Log ! ... and this year we have competing Yule Logs - gas on 26 and a really big wood-burning one on 36.   The drinking game is when ever they throw a log on (like ever 10 minutes) you have a drink, and when they poke you drink, and of course drink when ever they have a pop up ad.
