Last night Megan and I made spritz cookies, I made the dough and pressed them out and she decorated them with lots and lots of sprinkles.  This morning I made  [Spiced Pumpkin Bread](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/840) .  To say the house smells yummy is an understatement.  

I still plan on making fudge, and 2 pies for xmas day.  Jack is going to make cinnamon rolls for breakfast xmas morning.  And to top it all off, we&apos;re thinking of making Calzones for the dinner on xmas.
