Yesterday was a strange day indeed.  I woke up to a broken toilet in our (the tank won&apos;t fill with water).  The plumber is coming today but I had to play phone tag with them for most of the day to get that set.  Sadie&apos;s $150 meds I&apos;d opened wed evening smelled like cat pee and when i opened the reserve bottle from the same lot it too smelled so I had to run to the vet and return them, only they had no other so she&apos;s med free until they get a new batch in. Both of these odd, but even odder happening together. 

But the strangest thing was After I put Megan down last nigh, I was  installing Megan&apos;s carseat back in my car (we had my car serviced). I was accosted by two of  the cutest little white dogs.  I couldn&apos;t lock them in our  side yard cause they escaped so I put them in my car and waited for the dog catcher. I do hope their owner finds them, or they go to a great home. they were so loveable.
