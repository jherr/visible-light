I did my time in Megan&apos;s class room today.  Megan was awesome and it was wonderful to see her interacting and with the other kids and learning.  

Of the seven kids in Megan&apos;s class i&apos;d say only one is really a spoiled brat.  The rest played well together and really seemed to enjoy each others company.  But one little girl is more than just a handful.  She was down right rude to her fellow school mates and her teachers.  She did what ever she wanted and didn&apos;t listen to any instruction.  i was absolutely flabbergasted at how poorly this one child behaves compared to the other kids.  I definitely think its how she&apos;s being raised at home.  Her mother has repeatedly told me stories of how the child demands her own way and how they give in.  I just didn&apos;t believe that such parenting would create such a monster.
