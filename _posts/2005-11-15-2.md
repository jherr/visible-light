A few months ago I felt like a bubble bath.  Not having any bubble bath here, I went out and bought  [this](http://www.thebodyshop.com/bodyshop/browse/product_detail.jsp?productId=prod160275&categoryId=cat30002)  and well after one soak, Oso wouldn&apos;t leave me alone.  I&apos;m not quick, so I didn&apos;t pick up that he was smelling me, until a week later when I took another bath.  Ok having a dog follow you around and want to inhale you is off putting to say the least and so I haven&apos;t used the bubble bath until tonight, when I used it to soak my feet in the massaging bubbling foot bath Jack gave me for Christmas a few years ago. 

I finished up and headed to the sofa and he comes in climbs up and proceeds to give my feet kisses.  I kid you not-  this strange dog is loving my toes.  Jack if you want Oso to love you, may I suggest a bubble bath :)
