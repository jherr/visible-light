My air-cast has been replaced by a big boot.  I went to an orthopedic Surgeon today to have him look at my x rays and ankle.  He thinks he may see something that requires surgery but needs an MRI to see for sure - so I will go there on monday.  Fun Fun Fun.

Till then and after if hopefully I don&apos;t have to have surgery I get to have the biggest foot!  for a while anyway.  I took it off tonight for a shower and realized just how heavy this sucker is!  I&apos;ll have to get Jack to post a photo.
