Megan at 2 meals today - both Pizza.  First we met Grandpa at the hospital for lunch (he volunteers there) and Megan after much delay decided she wanted Pizza.  

Tonight for dinner we meet some of Grandpas friends at what turned out to be a mostly italian new york style restaurant and the smell of pizza was so strong ( and mouthwatering) there was no convincing Megan to have anything else...

which leads me to poop.  When she finally pooped today it was hard and easy to clean... until midnight when I went to goto bed and realized she had pooped again.  I realize now the first poop was a cork.  i tried to change her without fully waking her but no luck.  I did finally get her back in her own bed after I held her and she fell back asleep.    So green veggies tomorrow at the very least I need to get that girl pooping earlier in the day!
