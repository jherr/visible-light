I&apos;ve had a terrible bout of insomnia lately.  I didn&apos;t realize why until last night.  Our spa has been broken for the last month.  It finally got fixed and was hot enough to use last night and low and behold after getting in it I was able to fall asleep faster and while I still woke up a few times I just feel more rested.  I suppose all the sleepless night could have just finally caught up wth me - I guess I&apos;ll see tonight.
