We rushed home from Costco because I suddenly remembered the bug man was coming this afternoon.  I said Yippee when we got home and saw he hadn&apos;t been yet, so I ran around the yard picking up Megan toys and dog chews and water bowls.  Then I put away all the costco goodies.  and now we wait.  I know the dogs will go crazy when he arrives so starting the nap process is silly, but its already 2:30 if we don&apos;t get it going soon it&apos;s pointless.  So we wait....

and How we need the bug man - the darn mosquitos are starting to invade.   Megan is playing out back, waiting for the bug man so she can start her pooh and then take a nap.
