Jack and I went to  [IKEA](http://www.ikea.com)  today to look at office furniture and to buy two simple shelving units to hold our dvd&apos;s in the front closet.  Jack went off to Paddy&apos;s to get some work done, and I headed to garage to try and put one shelving unit together.  Well one hour later, both units are done.  Too heavy for me to install in the house, but done and waiting for Jack.

Let me just pat myself on the back!
