I had a bit of a chance to defend my actions of the last week.  A person I respect gave me pause, but in the end I was still very firm and clear in my intent.  Its a good exercise though.  When you want something that is so decisive and so definitive.  To have someone play devils advocate, and if then you can still say without a doubt that your still sure.  That your intentions are still clear then that really says something.  

Here I am all cryptic again.  Can&apos;t help myself.
