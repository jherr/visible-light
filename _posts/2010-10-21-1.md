A new website called Patch.com is a collection of local papers.  The one for Union City is wonderful - I&apos;ve been really enjoying having access to local news and information - it really makes the community seem so much more connected.

 [Patch Union City is here.](http://unioncity.patch.com/)  go to Patch.com to see if your town is represented yet.<br />
