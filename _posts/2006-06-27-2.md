I often Tivo Pilots to see what new shows are out there.  Most of the time I start the first 10 mins and then hit the delete button.  I had that expectation with a new show on ABCFamily called &quot;Kyle XY&quot;, only this time 10 mins in I was closing up my lap top so that I could pay attention.  I watched the entire pilot amazed at how much I enjoyed it.  I then went and got a season pass.  The premise is a teenage boy wakes up in the forest and has no memory of who or what he is, he has no belly button.  As he begins to explore he stumbles on civilization that really doesn&apos;t know what to do with him.  

I noticed it was going to rerun on regular ABC sometime this weekend - give it a gander,
