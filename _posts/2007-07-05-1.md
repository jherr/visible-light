Ok I meant to blog yesterday but just never got around to it but happy Belated 4th!  We had a great day - Jack and Megan got Bagels while I worked out (Jack had woken up much earlier and worked out before I even opened my eyes!)  Then Jack and I moved dirt in our back yard while Megan played.  Then I went in and showered and we headed to the pool for Megan&apos;s swim lesson.  

After that we ran a few errands and went back to the pool and hung for 3 hours of swimming fun!  At this point we were all sun drained so we headed home ( and skipped an open house BBQ - sorry Jen).  We played a family round of &quot;Mario Party 8&quot; for Wii, before Jack made dinner and I mowed the back.  We ate outside and enjoyed watching Duncan finish off Megan&apos;s corn on the cob - he ate it like a human biting the kernels off.  After Megan had a bath and we read a few books, we put on some sweats and piled into the back of the truck to watch our neighbors try and burn it all down.  It was a lot of fun and for an illegal  show the neighbors a few streets away put on a hell of a display.

Off to bed but not before we realized the Valium had done nothing to calm Oso so we slipped him a benedryl and he was soon fast asleep!
