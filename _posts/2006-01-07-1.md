Megan woke up this morning with a 104 fever.  We&apos;ve cooled her down, and she&apos;s resting with me iin bed, but its clear she&apos;s got my bug.  We thought she gave it to me and had had a milder form.  Well she must have had something else cause now she&apos;s as sick as I was, and i&apos;m not that much better.

Bad bug... beware!
