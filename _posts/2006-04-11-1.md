I went to see  [Anna Nalick](http://www.annanalick.com/)  in concert on Sunday night with Jeanetta our Baby sitter.  The concert was really wonderful.  Her music was something I liked and occasionally listened too but now after her great performance and stage presence I&apos;m a true fan.  I would gladly see her again.  One of the better concerts in my life time.  The venue was smallish and intimate.  It reminded me of my college groupie days and made me feel a tad old. 

I blogged about this concert the night after, and I went on and on describing it and how much it all meant - when damn if I didn&apos;t close the window and loose all my work - the result is a much shorter entry just telling you basically that I went.  ah - such is life.
