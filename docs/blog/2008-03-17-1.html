	<meta name="description" content="<p>Last sunday morning I woke up to find a starbucks coffee,(Grande Decaf, Soy Misto)  MMMmmmmm.  Jack had been up early and had visited our local (brand new) drive through.    Later on in the day, I was out running errands and felt like a cold drink so I swung by starbucks and picked up an ice tea.  (Venti Black ice tea with 3 pumps of sweetener).  Finally after dinner Jack went out while I was putting Megan to bed and surprised me with another coffee (also a soy decaf misto)  When he got back I realized that was 3 starbucks in one day - my new all time record.  So I decided I needed to take a break - a Starbucks Fast!</p>

		<p>Last sunday morning I woke up to find a starbucks coffee,(Grande Decaf, Soy Misto)  MMMmmmmm.  Jack had been up early and had visited our local (brand new) drive through.    Later on in the day, I was out running errands and felt like a cold drink so I swung by starbucks and picked up an ice tea.  (Venti Black ice tea with 3 pumps of sweetener).  Finally after dinner Jack went out while I was putting Megan to bed and surprised me with another coffee (also a soy decaf misto)  When he got back I realized that was 3 starbucks in one day - my new all time record.  So I decided I needed to take a break - a Starbucks Fast!</p>

<p>MOnday morning I was really easy since Megan's school had a field trip to the  <a href="http://www.thetech.org/">Tech Museum</a>  so I had no temptation.  When we got back I took Megan out for a treat (Ice Cream) for being such an angel on the field trip.  SO I was going along fine until our poker crew showed up and suddenly they all wanted Starbucks and so they headed out the door while I made my self a pot of drip.  Not only did I managed to not fall to peer pressure, but they returned with not one but 2 extra coffee's (of Corse one was a caffeinated latte and the other had 10 pumps of chocolate in it!)</p>

<p>I survived the rest of the week with out incident.  Even Jack and Mel tantalizing me on friday with (its Mel treat!) didn't sway me.  I survived going to Megan's one hour ice skating lesson with just a book and DS to entertain me - no Coffee to keep me warm.</p>

<p>But now the week is over.  I'm trying to decide the best way to bring starbucks back.</p>

<p>I did figure out that had I gone last week every time I normally would have I would have spent 23 dollars on just ice teas and coffee's (The Misto is just drip and is considerably cheaper than a latte. Had I still been doing Latte's I'm sure the bill would have been closer to 35!)  The trouble all started when the built the drive through starbucks a mile from our house.  Its such a temptation to swing by on the way home, or on my way out.</p>

<p>SO now that the fast is over, i'm going to limit myself to one ever couple of days.  And since our usual monday night crew is coming over tonight I'll wait till then to have my first one back.</p>
