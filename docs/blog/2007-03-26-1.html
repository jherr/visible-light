	<title>Tale as old as time... – Visible Light</title>
	<meta name="description" content="<p>I took Megan to see a local High school production of Beauty and the Beast yesterday - the same one Jack took her too a week ago.  We stopped and bought a bunch of flowers on the way and after the play Megan gave them to Belle.  I think Megan was a bit disappointed that the girl who played Belle didn't remember her, but its not surprising given how many little girls were vying for her attention.  As for the play it was well done for a highschool production.  It was a tad long and some of the performers seemed out of sorts.  My favorite was Lumiere and while Jack went on and on about Gaston, I did think he did a good job but the kid gave me the creeps.  Probably means his performance was spot on - just not my favorite.</p>

		<p>I took Megan to see a local High school production of Beauty and the Beast yesterday - the same one Jack took her too a week ago.  We stopped and bought a bunch of flowers on the way and after the play Megan gave them to Belle.  I think Megan was a bit disappointed that the girl who played Belle didn't remember her, but its not surprising given how many little girls were vying for her attention.  As for the play it was well done for a highschool production.  It was a tad long and some of the performers seemed out of sorts.  My favorite was Lumiere and while Jack went on and on about Gaston, I did think he did a good job but the kid gave me the creeps.  Probably means his performance was spot on - just not my favorite.</p>

<p>On the way to school this morning we passed a billboard for the play and she asked to see it again.  Very cute but she was a little bored yesterday so I think we'll wait until  <a href="http://www.starstrucktheatre.org/">Star Struck </a> puts in on in August.</p>
