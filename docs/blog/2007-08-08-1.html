	<meta name="description" content="<p>Its been very busy for me and Megan this week.  I guess its been a couple of weeks now.  Today for example we went with our neighbor and her grandson to Six Flags and had a wonderful time.  Tomorrow we're driving up to Mendocino to play with a friend who has gone on vacation there.  Earlier this week we saw Underdog (which Megan loved! - and I was entertained as well) had a dance class and a swim lesson.  On the weekend we went to a local art festival.  Last week was more of the same - every day busy!</p>

		<p>Its been very busy for me and Megan this week.  I guess its been a couple of weeks now.  Today for example we went with our neighbor and her grandson to Six Flags and had a wonderful time.  Tomorrow we're driving up to Mendocino to play with a friend who has gone on vacation there.  Earlier this week we saw Underdog (which Megan loved! - and I was entertained as well) had a dance class and a swim lesson.  On the weekend we went to a local art festival.  Last week was more of the same - every day busy!</p>

<p>Some cool news - I've reconnected with an old friend from college - because Jack put in that new spam filter thing he was talking about on his blog.  I'd been getting emails from Classmates.com for years since I'd first registered with them like 5 years ago.  But I just had been treating it like all spam easier to just say junk in mail than go back to the source and say no more.  but now that i'm not getting spam I've been going back to companies and saying remove me from your list - so I actually went in the email to find the stop emailing me address and saw that someone had left me an email like a week ago.  So I went in and wow-! it was a friend i'd been searching for and missing for 15 years! - way cool</p>

<p>I'm also loving having the iphone - today at Six flags, when we'd stopped to see a show or let the kids do a ride i'd pull it out and send emails and pictures to Jack.  It was great to just be able to look anything up I wanted when I wanted.  Funny though I've set the ringer to an old fashion phone, and today of all days I had 8 phone calls and managed to ignore them all because even though I heard the ringing I assumed it was a land line and it was probably coming from one of the vendors we were walking past!</p>

<p>Add to all this the fact that i'm in the midst of the final Harry Potter book and I've been addicted to Paper Mario on the Wii and well who has time to blog!</p>
