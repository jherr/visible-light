	<title>Lucky Day... – Visible Light</title>
	<meta name="description" content="<p>Today was a good day - a great day even.  First I managed to get up and get moving.  I did my workout, watered the plants fed Megan and myself breakfast, and made it out of the house with time to spare.  We drove over to the pool where despite not having a girl assistant today Megan was happy to get in and swim with her class (she was scared of her male instructor earlier in the week so they added a girl assistant for her).  Megan said she wanted a hot dog for lunch so I called Jack to find out if  <a href="http://www.wienerschnitzel.com/">Wienerschnitzel</a>  a fast food chain I've never been to was true to their name.  he didn't answer so I called my dad and he looked it up on the internet, and assured me it was a hot dog place.  So we headed over and I popped on the radio, only to hear "if your caller 9 you can win tickets!"  my cell phone still in hand and the number programed in from when they were giving away sting tickets I called and no Shit I was caller 9!</p>

		<p>Today was a good day - a great day even.  First I managed to get up and get moving.  I did my workout, watered the plants fed Megan and myself breakfast, and made it out of the house with time to spare.  We drove over to the pool where despite not having a girl assistant today Megan was happy to get in and swim with her class (she was scared of her male instructor earlier in the week so they added a girl assistant for her).

<p>I won tickets to see  <a href="http://www.livenation.com/event/getEvent/eventId/287978">Amy Winehouse</a>  in September in San Francisco!.</p>

<p>We had lunch and then I dropped Megan off at Little Gym for Gymnastics camp and went to the theater next door and saw Ocean's 13 - which was great.  I really enjoyed it.  I think Knocked Up was by far funnier (which I saw wednesday with my friend Simone)   Both movies get a thumbs up from me.</p>
