	<meta name="description" content="<p>Sadie finished her breakfast in the usual quick manner.  Oso ate part of his and has spent the last hour guarding the bowl.  Sadie has been hanging out with me because every time she dares to leave the bedroom and head towards the kitchen Oso jumps up and runs to get between her and the bowl.  I'm sure she knows he's protecting his food.  I know he probably won't finish it but will forget his game in like another hour.  As soon as the first squirrel leaves the tree for the day and he realizes it. His behavior though is so vexing to her… not that he's preventing her from eating but that he keeps jumping up in front of her and cutting her off down the hallway.  She's completely blind and he's being totally spastic.</p>
