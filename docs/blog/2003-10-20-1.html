	<title>DOLLAR STORE FIND – Visible Light</title>
	<meta name="description" content="<p>On Sunday while searching through our cd collection I rediscovered a dollar store find.  Back when Jack and I were first married, I frequented the dollar store down in Cutler Ridge Mall, maybe we were dating cause Hurricane Andrew blew the Cutler Ridge Mall away and the reopened much smaller mall later didn't have the dollar store.  Anyway one of the many things I would do was buy cd's from the dollar store and then try and resell them to CD Warehouse for 5 bucks. I know not very good and I think all told they only bought 1 cd from all my attempts.  One of the ones  I was stuck with was  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000068GFS/qid=1066703305/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/102-2053372-7295322?v=glance&amp;s=music">David Broza "Away From Home" </a>  Well I tried it and loved it.  Its a collection of American poetry by contemporary poets put to soulful folk music.  Its really well done and I"m glad I've re-found it.  The link here isn't for the same CD as it doesn't appear to be for sale anymore.</p>
