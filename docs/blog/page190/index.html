				<p><p>Megan's b-day is tomorrow and we have a houseful coming.  I'm going to start cooking this afternoon, the house keeper is cleaning for me right now, and Megan is getting bigger by the second!  I thought for sure she'd be walking by now cause her desire is  there but she hasn't gotten the balance thing down yet.  I'm kind of glad as I'm enjoying her crawling - its so adorable to here slap slap as she crawls down the hall.  Yesterday she and I explored the front yard while we were waiting for daddy to get home and she loved crawling on the grass, or rock or what ever else she found.  She picked leaves up and organized some white rocks and had a grand time.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">22 October 2003</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>HBO has done it again.  First Sopranos, then Six Feet Under, now  another show that is really turning out to be one of the best on TV with superb writing and acting.  <a href="http://www.hbo.com/carnivale/?ntrack_para1=leftnav_category0_show4">Carnivale</a> , takes place during the depression in the dust bowl.  Its follows a Carni troop and tells their very mixed up stories.  This weeks episode ended a 2 parter  -SPOILER ALERT- that had the Carnivale coming to a old mining town.  There they performed for an all male audience.   The girly show was a big hit and when one of the performers stripped down all the way, the miners went nuts.  Next thing they know she's been killed and the Carni folk are seeking retribution only no one is around to give it. As they try to figure out what is going on, you realize that all the miners are dead, and they have killed the "harlot" to have a woman to entertain them in entirety.  I shudder for the girl - and this is fiction.  As they left the town they showed her image in a window being pulled back in the room by a dirty miners arm.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">20 October 2003</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>On Sunday while searching through our cd collection I rediscovered a dollar store find.  Back when Jack and I were first married, I frequented the dollar store down in Cutler Ridge Mall, maybe we were dating cause Hurricane Andrew blew the Cutler Ridge Mall away and the reopened much smaller mall later didn't have the dollar store.  Anyway one of the many things I would do was buy cd's from the dollar store and then try and resell them to CD Warehouse for 5 bucks. I know not very good and I think all told they only bought 1 cd from all my attempts.  One of the ones  I was stuck with was  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000068GFS/qid=1066703305/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/102-2053372-7295322?v=glance&amp;s=music">David Broza "Away From Home" </a>  Well I tried it and loved it.  Its a collection of American poetry by contemporary poets put to soulful folk music.  Its really well done and I"m glad I've re-found it.  The link here isn't for the same CD as it doesn't appear to be for sale anymore.</p>

				<p><p>http://www.railtrails.org  Turning old railways that aren't used anymore into trails for bikers, walkers, etc.  Looks good and is a great idea  - apparently 1 cent of every dollar spent on roads and expressways is going to this concept.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Ripley's heart has broken.  Last night she was sure Jack would be coming home any minute so even though she came to bed with me she was quick to jump up and run to the front of the house for any noise.  Tonight, while Megan was in the bath she went to bed, and she hasn't moved since.  I'm now in bed, and she is sighing heavily and often.  Poor girl is depressed that Daddy has left her to me and Megan.</p>
