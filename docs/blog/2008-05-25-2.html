	<title>This mornings Wii Fit report – Visible Light</title>
	<meta name="description" content="<p>Jack started his workout on the Wii, then graduated to the elliptical in the garage where he still is.  I took over the wii and did 30 mins which included 2 runs (one basic with Megan running beside me and one at a longer distance)  Instead of just running in place I ran around the room - since the idea is the Wii-mote works as a pedometer - as long as your in range you can run around - better for the balls of your feet.  Megan and I agreed we'd try running at a park soon - though she'll have to slow down since she sprints and I plod along.</p>

		<p>Jack started his workout on the Wii, then graduated to the elliptical in the garage where he still is.  I took over the wii and did 30 mins which included 2 runs (one basic with Megan running beside me and one at a longer distance)  Instead of just running in place I ran around the room - since the idea is the Wii-mote works as a pedometer - as long as your in range you can run around - better for the balls of your feet.  Megan and I agreed we'd try running at a park soon - though she'll have to slow down since she sprints and I plod along.</p>

<p>I did a fair bit of yoga and strength stuff.  By the time I got around to Hula Hoops I was too  pooped and did pretty poorly.  I managed to finally get through the step aerobic routine, which is an exercise in frustration for both me and the Wii.  I opened the first boxing game and really enjoyed that one. Nice not to get hit back like in Wii Sports.</p>

<p>All told I worked out for over 30 minutes and really broke out into a sweat. Yesterday I did 30 minutes in the morning and then played around again in the afternoon for another 30 - in the last 2 day thats 1.5 hours more than I would have.  This thing is motivating me to move.</p>
