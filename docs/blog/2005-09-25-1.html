Its been great to spend time with my brother Michael, though the first 2 days he was understandably stressed about being here while his family was in Texas.  Once Saturday morning broke and it was clear that Katy was safe from Rita, we had a lovely visit.  Yesterday we hung out with Pam and Yvonne and did the  <a href="http://www.cornfieldmaze.com/sites.php?ID=&amp;username=cafremont">Corn Maze</a> , then came back to the house and cooked a great big pasta feast.</p>

		<p>We've had a house guest since the bitch "Rita" decided to take aim at Houston and all points east.  Its been great to spend time with my brother Michael, though the first 2 days he was understandably stressed about being here while his family was in Texas.  Once Saturday morning broke and it was clear that Katy was safe from Rita, we had a lovely visit.  Yesterday we hung out with Pam and Yvonne and did the  <a href="http://www.cornfieldmaze.com/sites.php?ID=&amp;username=cafremont">Corn Maze</a> , then came back to the house and cooked a great big pasta feast.</p>

<p>Today we took Megan to  <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/flightplan/">Flight Plan</a> .  Tomorrow Michael finally gets to go home which he is anxious to do.</p>

<p>So we get back from the movie and Megan is still up.  While Jack took the sitter home, I put Megan to bed.  She had been watching  <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/toy_story_2/">Toy Story 2</a>  and it was past her bed time so I said "bedtime" implying no books tonight.  She said "mommy read books"…. I looked at her beautiful face and said, "ok but just one"</p>

<p>"three" she replied holding up 3 fingers….. "No one" I assured her….. "two" she questioned holding up the sign for peace…. how could I refuse.  We headed to her room where she dutifully picked out only one book.  It was short and she was so lively that I relented and let her pick out another book.</p>

<p>Ok I know … I was the manipulatee and not the manipulator :)</p>
