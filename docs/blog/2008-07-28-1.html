	<title>Gilroy Gardens – Visible Light</title>
	<meta name="description" content="<p>Thanks to our Great America passes, we also get entrance to Gilroy Gardens.  Its a park aimed at much younger kids.  But what makes the park really enjoyable for adults are the incredible gardens.  We drove down with our neighbor and her grandson, arriving at opening.  One of the first rides we went to was one of those big ships that sway side to side.  Usually at the bigger parks these go upside down, but this one didn't so I figured I was safe.  and I was good for the first few swings and then we were completely 90 degrees up when I lost it screaming stop.  Since we were the only people on it the girl actually listened and hit the breaks - but it took another 2 swings before we were low enough for my heart to start beating again.  When we got off I apologized to the girl running it.  I should know better - I 'm a big chicken.  My neighbor offered to ride it with Megan since she still wanted it and that when we found out by hitting the breaks the ride now needed to be reset and maintenance was called - it would be 20 mins or so before the ride would be operational!</p>

<p>We headed off and Megan and Mrs Darlene did all the roller coasters, Trevor and Megan enjoyed the water play area, and we had a really dreadful lunch that the hornets wanted to eat more than we did.   Really it was a great day  - and after a drive home, we arrived to discover some really yummy homemade pizza thanks to Jack.</p>

Trevor and Mrs Darlene on the sky ride that goes through the butterfly house - however no actual butterflies were seen - probably because every door was propped open as we entered and exited.  This photo was taken so that I could email it to Trevor's mom.
