		<p>I have  <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7438">Chronic cryptic tonsillitis.</a>   I've had it for years and finally went to a doctor about it in January of 2002, but got pregnant with Megan in February and have just been putting up with them ever since.  So now I'm having them out - well not now but in a few weeks.  I went back to the same doctor last month and he agreed it was time.  The trouble is I've had now a month to stress about the pain.</p>

<p>When I had my gallbladder out I went from thinking I was having horrible gas, to having my sister in law Jen, who was visiting say that's what she thought I had, to the ER after passing out from the pain, to surgery all in a matter of days.  I didn't have time to google and read about other peoples stories and complications.</p>

<p>Its having too much information.  There is a fine line between being an informed patient and knowing too much.  I found today a detailed description of the surgery and it kind of freaked me out.  Normally I'd link to such things but honestly I don't want to go back and get the address.  I can rationally think ok I need this, in the long run I'll feel better, and I survived gallstone attacks and labor, I can survive pain.  But then I think - its gonna hurt its gonna hurt its gonna hurt!</p>

<p>Course I woke up this morning to a sore throat and a stiff achy jaw cause they are infected again and its time to have my tonsils out!</p>

<p>Surgery is planed for a friday and Megan is going to get her first sleep over at a friends thursday night.  Then Jack has the whole weekend to watch her while I recover and take pain meds,  I'll be back on full time duty monday but reserve the right to let my kid watch way to many movies if I feel like crap still.  I'm sure i'll blog about it….so watch this space.</p>
