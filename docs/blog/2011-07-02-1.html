We finally have the whole house buying/selling/re-financing mess behind us.  We can breath.  The house really suits us.  We have tons of small projects to do - The front flower bed I want to turn into a patio area - some how.  We have a mantel to build.  A back yard to return to beauty - already started with a new tree (Nectarine or peach we aren't sure)   A new rose bush that is very small but thriving.  I put a gardenia in the front in honor of my mom - lets see if I can keep it alive.</p>

		<p>I sit here typing this in my new office, the window open a sea breeze coming off the bay.  We finally have the whole house buying/selling/re-financing mess behind us.  We can breath.  The house really suits us.  We have tons of small projects to do - The front flower bed I want to turn into a patio area - some how.  We have a mantel to build.  A back yard to return to beauty - already started with a new tree (Nectarine or peach we aren't sure)   A new rose bush that is very small but thriving.  I put a gardenia in the front in honor of my mom - lets see if I can keep it alive.</p>

<p>Its a beautiful day.  Megan and Jack are at the park.  I left them there to start dinner, which I will shortly - Fresh Pesto from the basil we got at the farmers market tossed on Pasta with some grilled chicken.  Megan wanted to run.  It started as a bribe to watch tv but she enjoys the endorphins and asks to run laps at the park almost daily.   I have great hope that her love of the outdoors and exercise will keep her from ever battling the bulge.      We got her a new bike this week.  One that will last her a while, a small woman's bike for my tall beautiful California Girl.  And now her knees don't hit the handle bars.</p>

<p>We biked today this morning to the farmers market, and then this afternoon through the neighborhood, down a dirt road out toward the bay and then into another neighborhood.  Up to Megan's school and then back.  Which is when I left them at our park, this after a day of just chilling.   My favorite time today was laying on a blanket in the front yard and reading to Megan - we are in the middle of a book about a cat on an adventure called Tailchaser's song.  I read it as a child and wanted to share it with her.</p>

<p>I have 3 dogs at my feet sleeping, one is drugged because the forth is in 2 days and neighbors are already terrorizing him with fireworks.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I'm thinking the beach - half moon bay and Pescadero creek.  I bought a sunbrella - an enormous beach umbrella that will allow Jack to enjoy the beach.</p>

<p>Oops -  Megan and Jack are riding up the street and I still haven't started dinner.  Off I go…<br /></p>
