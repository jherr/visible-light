Jack made Pizza for everyone, I made the rest of the spread and everyone ate to their contented fullness.  We had a bounce house for entertainment, and I set up a coloring project and stamping and well the kids didn't want to leave - thank goodness the goody bags enticed them out the door.</p>

		<p>Today was Megan's 3rd birthday Party (actual birthday on Tuesday - a school day).  We had over 9 kids (plus siblings of the younger variety.  Jack made Pizza for everyone, I made the rest of the spread and everyone ate to their contented fullness.  We had a bounce house for entertainment, and I set up a coloring project and stamping and well the kids didn't want to leave - thank goodness the goody bags enticed them out the door.</p>

<p>So that's where I've been, busy planning and organizing and buying for this once a year extravaganza.  Megan had so much fun and really that made it all worth while.   I'm now in that exhausted but too antsy post organization, can't believe it came off faze.  Tomorrow I'll spend some quality time with the sewing machine finishing Megan's costume (for the costume parade on Thursday! at school,) before heading to Florida to see  <a href="http://www.muttmansion.com/dd">my old dad</a>  get hitched.  Its a quick trip so I'm going with out Megan for the first time since her birth.</p>
