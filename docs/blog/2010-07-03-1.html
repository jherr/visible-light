	<title>Volcano Tour Day 4 – Visible Light</title>
	<meta name="description" content="<p>Another leisurely start to our day.  We were out of the room after breakfast and up at the ranger station by 10.  Megan achieved her third Junior Ranger Badge, and then we asked the ranger about various easy hikes and sights that were still open despite the snow.  We jumped in the car and headed out of the park and found Alice Falls which turned out to be just on the side of the road but about 100 feet down a cliff.  Beautiful but kind of scary for us no hights types.</p>

		<p>Another leisurely start to our day.  We were out of the room after breakfast and up at the ranger station by 10.  Megan achieved her third Junior Ranger Badge, and then we asked the ranger about various easy hikes and sights that were still open despite the snow.  We jumped in the car and headed out of the park and found Alice Falls which turned out to be just on the side of the road but about 100 feet down a cliff.  Beautiful but kind of scary for us no hights types.</p>

<p>Heading back into the park we stopped again at the ranger station and asked the same ranger how to find the "Lady of the Woods" trail   - which turned out to be behind the ranger station and still snow covered.  He said he needed to stretch his legs and so he gave us a private tour and we climbed through the snow and saw her.  Basically a doctor in the 60s spent some time there and would spend his free time carving a rock in the shape of a woman sitting with her head down.  Kind of sad but well made for an amateur.  It surprised me that the Park service acknowledged her presence and even had a trail on all the maps, as they discourage that kind of distructive art.</p>

<p>Once trooping back through the snow and saying good bye to our ranger guide, we headed up to the Rim Village Cafe and picked up some sandwhich fixings.</p>

<p>We then drove out along the west Rim Road and pulled over at a less popular pull off over looking the lake.  Set up our camp chairs, dug out the cooler and enjoyed a picnic lunch followed by a little snow play complete with very small snow person.</p>

<p><img src="/images/assets/IMG_1538-thumb-600x800-53.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We then drove out the North Exit road and found the Pumice Desert, a section of forrest littered with stone and very hard for trees to reestablish in - considering the volcano errupted some 7000 years ago there were only a few skattered trees in this area.</p>

<p><img src="/images/assets/IMG_1539-thumb-600x450-56.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We drove back to the Inn at this point, and I read (A fiction novel called "Why Is Crater Lake so Blue" - Not great but it was interesting to read about where we were)  while Megan again played in snow.</p>

<p>At 3 we headed back up for one last trip to the Crater Rim and went to a ranger talk at the Lodge.  Remember when I said all ranger talks were so good - well this one was so boring.  It was about fire suppression and control and moniter methods, and she basically started in the middle without any real explanation as to what controled burns were about.  Megan was lost and though I understood a bit more, I spent more time thinking about how I jinxed us because I had so enjoyed our 3 previous ranger talks.</p>

<p>After we looked again out at the lake, rocking on the lodge veranda and meeting a couple of cool dogs who were lucky enough to come with their owners. We headed back down the mountain to Mazama Campground store, called Jack and then headed over to Alice Creek Cafe for dinner.  Its the same place we had lunch when we arrived and lunch was so much better then dinner.  I left a comment card filled out saying as much and we headed back to our room to start packing up so we could leave early tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>Next stop Lava Beds National Monument.<br /></p>
