I've been averaging 3 trips to the pool a week, 2 during Megan's school and once on the weekend.  That along with the elliptical trainer and a workout video i'm into and well i'm feeling better than I have in years. But now that Megan's school is out for the summer finding time to do laps is difficult.</p>

		<p>I got my sorry butt out of bed this morning at 6:15 and went to the pool to swim laps.  I've been averaging 3 trips to the pool a week, 2 during Megan's school and once on the weekend.  That along with the elliptical trainer and a workout video i'm into and well i'm feeling better than I have in years. But now that Megan's school is out for the summer finding time to do laps is difficult.</p>

<p>I saw that I could go between 6 and 9 and Jack agreed to work from home until I got back at 8.  It really worked out beautifully for about 45 minutes and then the pool was inundated with a bunch of slower swimmers and I started having to swim slow to keep from running over this older gentleman.  Long story short- i cut my work out down 15 minutes but it still felt good.</p>

<p>The only trouble is i'm not a morning person.  I'm a late night person.  I'm usually up till midnight on my laptop so i'm not sure I can last all summer getting up that early to swim laps.  For now i'll try to go one time during the week and then later on saturday, and If I can manage a third day all the better.  But by the end of summer I will be looking forward to Megan's return to school (3 mornings a week!)</p>
