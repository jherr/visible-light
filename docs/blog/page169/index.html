				<p><p>My sister was telling me Kerry flipped someone off and it was on tv.  I couldn't believe it so I spent some time this evening researching it.  The only "news" source I could find was NewsMax which says "NewsMax is already the leading conservative news site on the web"  There is no photographic evidence and it wasn't picked up by any mainstream media (though she thinks she saw it on a mainstream news show).  So you have Cheney who needs his mouth washed out with Soap who tells congress off on C-Span and you have Kerry who may or may not have flipped a guy off named Ted Sampley as he reported it to "NewsMax" and he has a track record as a Kerry hater.  No one else appears to have come forward.  Which would you be more offended by?</p>

				<p><p>On our flight yesterday, I was so annoyed with Delta I forgot a few points…Megan had a diaper malfunction in the airport and ended up peeing on me.  I had a change of close for her but none for myself so I figured it didn't matter.  Jack suggested I by a new shirt at the gift shop and I said no.  While waiting for the plane at the gate, I started smelling the pee more and more and decided what the hay I need a shirt from Atlanta.  The shop keeper wouldn't let me change in back and suggested the rest rooms some 10 gates away, I said forget it - a nursing mother has lost all modesty anyway and just changed right there in the front of the shop!  I think I gave the poor girl a heart attack.</p>

She was so tired that when I started singing our song after we brushed teeth, she just pointed to her bed and went straight down.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I thought today was the going to the be the day Delta tried to win me back, and it started out really well, I checked in well enough, the gentleman working the delta curb check in was really nice, but then I boarded the plane - 30 mins late, followed by and extended delay at the gate.  Turned out we were on Song, Delta's answer to Jetblue, so the TV at the seat was nice, but when the pilot taxied out a little girl got injured and we had to go back to the gate, wait for the EMT's to come and check her out, then over an hour for them to bring us an unopened first aid kit.  We were finally off, and the rest of the flight was fine.  Oh but I forgot to mention the worst part - NO A/C.  The plane was hot sitting at the gate in Atlanta, Hot taxi-ing to the runway and back again hot sitting at the gate waiting for the first aid kit, hot taking off, hot in the air and  - you guessed it HOT landing.  It was miserable.  Megan fell asleep during take off so the heat was good for something, but the (<em>&amp;^#$</em>  pilot came on about 30 mins out to tell us there was a delay and he had to circle around st pete to get into Tampa and the (<em>&amp;$</em>$( speaker was on way to loud and woke her up – not the HAPPY Megan everyone loves but a very tired cranky annoyed Megan who proceeded to cry all the way to tampa, all the way to the ground and all the way to the gate.</p>
