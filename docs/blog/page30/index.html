				<p><p>We got another early start to the day.  Well actually we were up early, but after breakfast, Megan asked to take another bath in the enormous tub.  SO we actually didn't get up to  <a href="http://www.lakeshastacaverns.com/index.html">the Caverns </a> until 9:50, but we were able to walk onto the 10 o'clock tour which was nice.  And by walk on I mean we had to walk down from the shop to the boat dock and then down to the actual boat since the water level of the lake is so very low.  Across the lake we merrily sailed.  And then we had to hike back up the lake bed to were a shuttle bus picked us up and took us the 1.4 miles to the cave entrance.  The Entrance was a big steel door that opened into a long narrow tunnel with many steps on the end.  We went up about 60 and then turned into the first "room"  We enjoyed exploring all the different rooms and in the end we travel well up into the mountain and had to walk down 250+ steps that were cut into the out side of the mountain to get back to the shuttle bus.  It was an exhausting adventure, and we still had to get down and up the darn lake bed.  But all in all we both really enjoyed the Caverns!</p>

				<p><p>We left by 9 which I must say is a small miracle.  I don't think I've ever successfully left on a road trip at the time I said I wanted to leave.  However traffic through Oakland meant that our trip to our first stop the  <a href="jellybelly.com/visit_jelly_belly/california_factory_tours.aspx">Jelly Belly Factory</a>  took much longer then the GPS promised 1 hour.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Megan and I are off tomorrow for a road trip through Redwood Country.  We'll be visiting a Jelly Bean Factory, some caves, a lake for a boat ride, and A museum.  Then we are on to Eureka - the original gold mine town before heading back south along the pacific coast highway.  We'll probably cut across early so as to not have to go through San Francisco on the way home.  The hotels I've book so far have wi-fi so energy willing, I'll blog from the road and share.</p>

				<p><p>One of our credit cards was sold out from under us to a different bank.  I was annoyed at first cause this is one of the cards I've had since collage.  But now I don't care in the slightest.  I went today to Bank 1 to pay off  the bill, They couldn't accept payment cause the card was no longer theirs despite the bill saying to send it to them, so I went to Bank 2 and they couldn't accept payment because the card wasn't in their system yet.</p>

				<p><p>I got my hair trimmed today.  I noticed my hair dresser who i've been using for the past 5 years seemed a little sad, and it turns out her mother died recently and unexpectedly.  Her mother helped her out in her shop and so I did know her a little as well.  I really feel for her - loosing my mom really effected me - still does to this day.  I can't tell you  how many times I've wanted to talk to her in the last 10 years. Seeing someone else going through it and being in such a raw state, what can I say - puts it all back into perspective.  Hold onto those you love dear ones….</p>
