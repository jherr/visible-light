	<title>New Masthead and other updates – Visible Light</title>
	<meta name="description" content="<p>I made a new masthead last night because Duncan is such a part of our lives and he wasn't on my old one - I probably won't change it monthly like  <a href="http://www.amanda.veryzen.com/">Amanda at Very Zen</a>  but once a quarter is a good goal - enough to reflect the changes in our life.    The middle picture where Megan is up on my shoulders was at Disney.  I ordered a bunch of prints last night from shutterfly from our trip and I plan on getting back into scrap booking - I haven't scrapbook since Megan's 2nd b-day which means i have 2 years to catch up on.</p>

		<p>I made a new masthead last night because Duncan is such a part of our lives and he wasn't on my old one - I probably won't change it monthly like  <a href="http://www.amanda.veryzen.com/">Amanda at Very Zen</a>  but once a quarter is a good goal - enough to reflect the changes in our life.    The middle picture where Megan is up on my shoulders was at Disney.  I ordered a bunch of prints last night from shutterfly from our trip and I plan on getting back into scrap booking - I haven't scrapbook since Megan's 2nd b-day which means i have 2 years to catch up on.</p>

<p>The swim is going well.  Jack and I split the weekend - he swam on Saturday and I got sunday - since the lap pool is only open for a few hours in the morning on those days.  I don't get to swim today cause its a holiday and they have weekend hours, and Megan is home, instead i'll do this exercise video since its too cold to use the elliptical in the garage - I'll admit it I'm a wus :)</p>

<p>We had a really lovely weekend.  Saturday was just quiet -After Jack swam, I got a hair cut while Jack and Megan went up to  <a href="http://www.starstrucktheatre.org/">Star Struck's</a>  production of Peter Pan!.  Megan loved it and the production value was really good.  The enormous cast  of kids did a really wonderful job.  There was one adult  - The man who played hook and he was particularly good.</p>

<p>Megan and I have a quiet day planned - she is out of school for the holiday so we are going to meet a friend and go see Charlotte's web.  After lunch we plan on running the kids around the park - despite the cold.  Probably the park across from  <a href="http://www.paddyscoffee.com/">Paddy's</a>  so the mom's can have hot beverages to keep us warm.  Reminds me I need to go throw my Jacket and scarf in the dryer or i'll be freezing my ass of this morning.</p>
