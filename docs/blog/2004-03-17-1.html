		<p>Today Megan and I had an excellent day.  First we had our day at Little Gym.  Megan absolutely loves going to the gym and playing on all the equipment.  She absolutely brightens up when we get there and she throughly enjoyed all the activities.  She is a little obsessed with the water-fountain though.</p>

<p>Afterwards we went and had a picnic at the rides park at the Oakland Zoo.  Megan enjoyed the carousal and then after lunch we stood in line for 40 mins to ride the train.  Ok the line was no fun, but the train was great!  Afterwards we went in to see the camels and elephants and wow ONe of the elephants was in the water and really close.  Megan stared at it while and then it splashed her.  She was entranced.  I hope I got some good pictures.  Anyway we stood there for at least 20 mins while she got repeatedly splashed and the elephant "Lucy" begged for Apple bites and she sprayed water at her keeper.  When Megan finally had her fill we headed to the car past the camels.</p>

<p>…well the camels were in the middle of having sex, and the female on the bottom was moaning loudly. The male was pumping  and frothing at the mouth.  I took a few pictures and figure Jack will post my camel porn later on when he downloads the camera.  It was a really funny looking sight.</p>

<p>Megan is now napping and I'm relaxing!</p>
