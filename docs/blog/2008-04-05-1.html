		<p>It has only been a month since I last forgo starbucks, and since i've been limiting myself to once or twice a week.  I'm giving them up again because I had a rude experience there and well It was a bit of a final straw.</p>

<p>On my way to Megan's Karate class thursday afternoon, I pulled into the drive through because I was craving an Iced Coffee.  When I got to the window I placed my order … Iced Grande Decaf please.</p>

<p>The reply I got was - We can't do that!.  What do you mean?  We can do regular Iced but not decaf - What ? I say come again?  he repeats it.   I don't want a frappacino I just want iced Decaf coffee.  He then says - look I know what you want and we can't do it.</p>

<p>Its on your menu - right under drip - Iced Coffee - Regular or decaf.  - NO he yells its not.  I'm looking right at it.  Do you have ice? I ask… yes he says… Do you have decaf coffee?  … Yes he says - so why the hell can't you put the two together and give me an Iced DECAF Coffee?</p>

<p>Because we aren't allowed. - FIne - Me and my money are leaving. and I drove through .  As I went around the building I noticed an employee come out and go look at the menu - But for me that was it - I don't kindly to being told no when I'm reading it off the damn menu.  I'm sure if I conplained to corporate I'd get an apology and maybe even a coupon for a freebie - but really this just reinforces to me that I need to give up starbucks once and for all.  Its crazy to spend so much on coffee - when I make decent at home.</p>

<p>On a side - the very next day Megan had Gymnastics and I never did get my iced coffee - so I brewed some coffee - added Ice and was happy all the way to Gymnastics.</p>
