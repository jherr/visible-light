				<p><p>It snowed this morning.  I was busy sewing my new invention the Gee Keeper, as no where in Walla Walla sold the crib tent ( I'll have Jack take pictures for me later when its on her pac-n-play-  we had a leaky diaper incident and her sheets are in the dryer."  Anyway I was busy sewing when Jack hollered that it was snowing.  When I came down we took Megan out and Sadie out and enjoyed the snow for a few minutes… but before we made it in it had turned to Rain.  Still Megan has now officially seen her first "s-no"!</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>The one thing about getting a group together of like minded individuals is that the constant talk about Politics can get tiresome.  When my family gets together we tend to avoid any topic that might cause strife which means we basically talk about Poop, death and sex.  But Jack's side of the family, all agree politically so the conversation is dominated with Politics, more Politics and alittle Religion.  On the other  hand though it is great to have a room of people who agree with you and want to hear what you have to say.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>After a tiring walk around Walla Walla and lots of playing with the boys, I took Megan up for some Bear and animals (dvd) and then a nap.  10 minutes after I put her down upstairs and shut the door, she appeared down stairs with her blanket, one of her Aunt Jen's baskets which had my moisturizing cream and her socks in it.  This meant that she not only climbed out of the pack and play but she also opened a door, did the stairs all by herself with her arms full.  I took her back up to our room and cuddled with her while she cried realizing that I was still intent on her napping, when she'd calmed down I put her in the crib and went out the door.  before I made it around into the next room to peak through the french doors, she was out of her crib!</p>

				<p><p>So on my journey my laptop started flaking out.  I was loosing the monitor and a good shake would bring it back and then it would go away again… it was frustrating.  But I was determined to fix it.  Until … Jack arrived today with a brand new G4 Ibook.  It took less than one hour for my old machine to tell my new machine everything it needed.  And now I'm all set to go.. even my picture of Megan transfered.  It has everything.</p>

				<p><p>We just got home from a wonderful night.  Jen and Thom treated us all to a lovely dinner and then we enjoyed Community theater production of  <a href="http://www.ltww.org/season.htm">Over my Dead body</a> .  It was a wonderfully funny play and very well done for a local theater troop.  It was a fun romp about mystery writers trying to commit a crime. The female lead did an excellent job, as did the actor who played the butler.</p>

				<p><p>I cuddled with Maddie the Bolduc's dog last night and she got up at 5.  Megan started talking loudly while I was in the bathroom, so I hid downstairs with my laptop and coffee.  I don't like to let her get up before 7.  She usually settles back down and falls asleep if I just leave her be.  She wasn't crying, just talking.  Going through all her words and having fun in the process.  She's already starting to settle, but I'm sure she'll be talking again once Sadie wakes up and heads down for breakfast.</p>
