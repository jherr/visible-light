		<p>Since I moved here i knew our local mall had a program for toddlers called  <a href="http://www.newparkmall.com/html/EventDetail.asp?ecd=76895">Club Noggin</a> .  I could never seem to remember when it was so we've missed it every time.  But the other night I got an email from a mom friend reminding us that it was today.  So I packed Megan and I lunch and picked her up from school rushed over.</p>

<p>Well, we did miss the first 10 minutes.  But the rest sucked.  The woman who ran it was oblivious to the skills of a 3 year old.  She instructed them to make a snow flake telling them to cut the fold, talking way above each kids head. Megan was scared of her but tried to participate.  The woman came over told Megan she was doing it wrong and grabbed the paper from her.  Then she cut it.  Megan got up and came back over to me.  I tried to get Megan to goto one of the other people running it.  Another woman seemed so friendly and playful with the kids, but in the end she sat with me outside the ring and asked when she could go home.</p>

<p>There was a male assistant too… who sang and he spent his off stage time looking thoroughly bored and annoyed at where his life had taken him.</p>

<p>Needless to say we won't bother with that activity again.</p>
