<p>Well what a crock. NO RECEIPT NO RETURN is there policy and since we didn't have even a gift receipt we were refused.</p>

<p>Rather than tell you the whole mess, I offer instead my letter to the CEO of TRU.</p>

<p>Friday, October 31, 2008</p>

<p>Gerald L. Storch 
Chairman and CEO
Toys"R"Us, Inc. Headquarters 
One Geoffrey Way
Wayne, New Jersey 
07470-2030</p>

<p>Dear Mr Storch,</p>

<p>I am writing to tell you that your store lost a customer today, actually three because my husband, daughter and myself will not shop there again.</p>

<p>I have been a long time shopper at Toy R Us and have never had an issue at your stores.  I have bought lots of birthday gifts and always included the gift receipt with the gift.    My daughter just turned 6 and was given several board games she already had.  There was no gift receipt with it, but one of the games had a sticker on it that said â€œOnly at Toys R Usâ€ See Picture:</p>

<p><img src="/images/assets/candyland.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So my daughter and I headed over to your Newark California store this afternoon, and she was very excited to pick out a new Barbie for the board games.    After standing in a long line because only one register was open, I finally came up and asked to return the items.  The assistant Manager informed me that your return policy is that nothing can be returned with out a receipt.  I actually left at this point but by the time I got out to the car I realized that this had to be wrong and I went back in and asked to talk to the manager.  The assistant Manager told me she was the only one in the store and gave me the customer service phone number (800)TOYSRUS.</p>

<p>I called right there from my cell phone.  After going through what seemed like endless prompts I finally hit Zero and was connected to a live person.   I explained what was happening and was told that was store policy.  I asked for her supervisor and explained again to the next woman on the line.  She also spent time explaining to me that she had no power, and then I was passed through to Melissa who told me she was the top supervisor and it was just to bad there was nothing I could do.  When I asked her what should I do with this game because we already had one she said â€œopen it up and play it with your daughter.â€</p>

<p>This I believe was the final straw and I behaved very badly at this point.  I yelled in front of all your other customers and said many four-letter words, but the truth is I had been beyond patient with your staff and your ridiculous policy and I had reached my end.  I hung up and left.</p>

<p>I then took the other game to Target and they accepted it with out a gift receipt.  My daughter then went over and bought several Barbie dolls.  This is how it should have worked at your store.  Target put Toy's R Us to shame.</p>

<p>So what do I want from you?  Well I plan now on giving the game in question to Toy's for Tots this Christmas.  You can be sure that none of my Christmas shopping will happen in your store, and that I won't step foot in any Toy's R Us stores again. You can also be sure I will tell my story to any one who will listen.</p>

<p>But I want you to fix this policy so that another parent doesn't have to go through it again.  You can figure something out.  Target told me that I could return 2 items with out a receipt and then they would put a hold on my name and not let me do it again for a year.  That's fair it ensures that people can't steal.   If you want to keep your customers especially in this current economy, your company needs to figure this out.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Lauren Herrington</p>
