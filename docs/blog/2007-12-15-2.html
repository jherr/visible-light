	<meta name="description" content="<p>We have a sitter for the month.  Our sitter when off to collage last fall, after our previous one moved to LA and with the whole foot break I never found another.  So we just haven't been going out really.  We don't live near family so we used some friends occasionally, and our local little gym has had some Parent Survival nights. We've gotten by just fine.  But our collage sitter is home for the holidays and we've been taking advantage.  Tonight we went out with friends while their daughter and Megan hung out here and had a night of it.  We went out to dinner, and then walked over to the local mega-plex to see  <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/i_am_legend/">I Am Legend</a> .</p>

		<p>We have a sitter for the month.  Our sitter when off to collage last fall, after our previous one moved to LA and with the whole foot break I never found another.  So we just haven't been going out really.  We don't live near family so we used some friends occasionally, and our local little gym has had some Parent Survival nights. We've gotten by just fine.  But our collage sitter is home for the holidays and we've been taking advantage.  Tonight we went out with friends while their daughter and Megan hung out here and had a night of it.  We went out to dinner, and then walked over to the local mega-plex to see  <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/i_am_legend/">I Am Legend</a> .</p>

<p>Let me say first off this is a good movie.  Its well made and Will Smith is off the hook good.  But here's where I know I'm getting old.  It was way to intense for me.  I spent large portions of the movie hiding in Jack's arm and back.  Other parts my hands sufficed.  At one point it calmed down and Jack ran out to get something sweet and I thought - Damn he better get back before I need to hide my head again!</p>

<p>I was so anxious - I actually used up my Deodorant - Even now - after a shower and with Little People Big World on the TV, my heart is pounding just thinking about this movie.  So go if you enjoy that sort of thing.  But if I were you I'd wait for DVD, small tv's and the ability to leave the room.</p>
