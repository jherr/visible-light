				<p><p>yesterday I woke up to find that our fridge was not cold but cool and a puddle of water on the floor of it.  So Megan and I spent the morning looking at fridge replacements, picked one out, and bought it.  They said it would be delivered today and that I would be called around 11 about what time.</p>

				<p><p>While Megan is in school I've been taking a once a week sewing class at  <a href="http://www.seamsdreamy.qpg.com/">Seams Dreamy</a> .  Well I'm working on a piglet costume for Megan and the damn strips on his body are killing me.  I can't seem to stitch them on with out the zig zag zigging.  i've already had to tear out the same strip twice.  I know Renee will make it all better thursday, but its frustrating not to be able to get this one part done.</p>

				<p><p>so Megan had a great day yesterday without a nap, playing with her friend Josephine first at her house and then at ours.  She slept in this morning till 9:30 and when she woke up Jack went into get her so she knew it was still the weekend.  After her 3 hour nap this afternoon, she woke up to me opening her door and jumped out of bed very excited.  We went to the potty and while she was sitting there she said… "School today!"  I said not sweetie its night time, we're making dinner and then bath read books and cuddle.  She gave me a very cute pout and said "no Megan go school!"  I said no "but you can take OSO on a walk with Daddy"  well the tears started rolling then and she said "no Daddy go work, Megan go to school!"  I said I was sorry and offered to cuddle and she finished on the potty and we headed to the sofa where she had me hold her while she pouted and teared for 20 mins.</p>

				<p><p>I finished Harry Potter's latest installment this evening.  I know Megan will be ecstatic when she realizes mommy's not reading anymore.  I'm relieved to not be so hooked I'm trying to figure out how to get my next fix.  And overall I have to say I don't think this installment of HP was as well delivered as the previous 5.  I could see scenes set up for the movie more than I could previous books, and this annoyed me.  Don't get me wrong it was a great book and I was entertained and I'm looking forward to the next (supposedly last but I doubt it), but I think it was more thrown together, more ad-hoc.</p>

				<p><p>We've had a house guest since the bitch "Rita" decided to take aim at Houston and all points east.  Its been great to spend time with my brother Michael, though the first 2 days he was understandably stressed about being here while his family was in Texas.  Once Saturday morning broke and it was clear that Katy was safe from Rita, we had a lovely visit.  Yesterday we hung out with Pam and Yvonne and did the  <a href="http://www.cornfieldmaze.com/sites.php?ID=&amp;username=cafremont">Corn Maze</a> , then came back to the house and cooked a great big pasta feast.</p>

				<p><p>When  <a href="/vl/archives/001990.html">Oso killed the snake</a>  it was after weeks of interest in the Rosemary bush.  He wouldn't leave that bush alone and he drove us all crazy with his determination to watch the bush 24/7.  Afterwards he never even went near the bush so I figured that must have been the snakes home.</p>
