		<p>My mail app on my iphone is broken.  Jack played with it last night and actually made the problem worse.  Its been weird not having access to mail 24/7  but really do we need that anyway?</p>

<p>Jack's Cinnamon roll recipe was included in a cookbook celebrating the 50th birthday of our city.  We  figured it had been rejected because he never heard a peep out of the organizers after submitting it but I saw the cookbook yesterday at  <a href="http://paddyscoffee.com/">Paddy's coffee shop </a> and there it was.  The other recipes look interesting.  A few standbys and a a few flavors I've never tried.</p>

<p>I spent 4+ hours getting my car fixed yesterday.  The first one was them diagnosing the problem and doing an oil change.  Then they came in and told me what they needed and I said go ahead - He thought the part would be there in an hour and a half and that they would be ready to put it in and the car back together.  It of course didn't arrive for close to 3 hours and so I sat and waited - A cab seemed so wasteful, but by the end I'd wished I'd just left my car.   I did use my iphone to entertain myself - I played a few games and watched the Oscars on You tube.  I also managed to find Animated short that won which I thought was a bit depressing in so many ways.  I now really wish the  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qreOELd35Ig">Octopus's in love one</a>  had won - it was on CBS Sunday morning and is worth a watch.   I also enjoyed the Lavatory Love Story - it was very cute.</p>
