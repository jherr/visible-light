	<title>Happy Birthday to me... – Visible Light</title>
	<meta name="description" content="<p>Its been a really wonderful birthday so far…i'll start the saga, friday night.  Megan's school had its Holiday show, and Megan just shined.  She sang Jingle Bells and Feliz Navidad and was just so cute.  Jack got it on video and hopefully he'll put it up.  After the brief show, Santa came and gave each kid a goodie bag, and then we headed out to our favorite Thai restaurant for a late dinner.  We ended the evening driving around looking at xmas light and then Megan and I walked around our neighborhood looking at some of her favorite displays.</p>

		<p>Its been a really wonderful birthday so far…i'll start the saga, friday night.  Megan's school had its Holiday show, and Megan just shined.  She sang Jingle Bells and Feliz Navidad and was just so cute.  Jack got it on video and hopefully he'll put it up.  After the brief show, Santa came and gave each kid a goodie bag, and then we headed out to our favorite Thai restaurant for a late dinner.  We ended the evening driving around looking at xmas light and then Megan and I walked around our neighborhood looking at some of her favorite displays.</p>

<p>Saturday Jack had a phone interview with a radio show, so Megan and I headed up to  <a href="http://www.lakeshorelearning.com/">Lakeshore Learning</a>  to do the saturday art project.  It was a new years noise maker, and Megan had alot of fun.</p>

<p>Then we returned home and Jack and Megan headed out to "treasure hunt", while I headed out to see  <a href=":http//www.rottentomatoes.com/m/brokeback_mountain/">BrokeBack Mountain</a>   This movie was if not the best than one of the best love stories i've ever scene put to screen.  Heath Ledger should get the oscar, so should the movie, and the director Ang Lee.</p>

<p>Saturday night Megan and I met my friend Kari and her son Derek for dinner at a local Pizza place.  After we headed back here and the kids watched Rudolf the Red Noise rain deer while Kari and I drank a bottle of wine and entertained Jack with our crazy talk.  The evening ended with a bang, the kids beating drums and running around making lots of noise.</p>

<p>I started my b-day celebration officially there cause well Kari gave me a really cool gift basket of gourmet wine and sauces that looks yummy.</p>

<p>Sunday came and Jack had me kidnapped by Pam and we went off and had hot stone massages at  <a href="http://www.maxsworld.com/">Max's Opera Cafe</a>  before heading home to cake and presents.  Jack and Yvonne and the girls decorated the cake, and then enjoyed a morning of bouncing.  Jack gave me a new telescope, a small compact one ( I think the one I gave you dad), and last night despite the clouds we went out and looked at Mars.  Its great and very light weight.  It'll probably inspire me to drag out my big one, since I'll look at things, and think, you know with that 80lb monster i'd be able to see this so much better!,  but for introducing Megan to the stars, its perfect.</p>

<p>Last night I had a holiday party with my mom friends.  We met at  <a href="http://www.lavandarestaurant.com/">Lavanda</a>  which honestly while the company was wonderful, the food was a bit over priced for what it was.  I had a nice butternut squash soup and a salad for 19 dollars, with a soda and a bottle of water we all split, cause I didn't know that flat wasn't tap, we each paid 31 bucks.  Desserts would have added another 10 on top so some of us enjoyed some gelato on the way to the car.</p>

<p>Today is my actual birthday, so Megan and I are going to  <a href="http://www.bestofbroadway-sf.com/shows/show.asp?key=18&amp;subkey=407">Lestat</a>  in the pre-broadway release!.  we'll have dinner first somewhere in the theater district.  So I have to say its been and is an excellent birthday!</p>
