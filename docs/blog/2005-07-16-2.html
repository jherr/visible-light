The wand was nolonger the powerful hose that could suck a cobweb off the sealing from 5 feet away!  I just wasn't sure why - and figured that with age it would just not be as powerful.</p>

		<p>I know I haven't shared my love for all things  <a href="http://www.dyson.com">Dyson</a>  in a while, basically i've been thinking that the Dyson wasn't all that, since while it was incredible in the beginning, lately it hasn't been doing that great of a job.  The wand was nolonger the powerful hose that could suck a cobweb off the sealing from 5 feet away!  I just wasn't sure why - and figured that with age it would just not be as powerful.</p>

<p>Cut to this morning - Jack and Megan and Oso are out getting bagels and i'm using the time to vacuum.  I get to the kitchen and just can't get the wand to suck up a coffee bean - which use to be an easy suck.  I turn it off and start taking it apart.</p>

<p>In the tube at the base of the wand where it bends and enters the vacuum proper if found a ball point pen, a water bottle cap, 2 small farm animal toys, a wad of dog hair, and who knows what else.  I removed the big pieces, put the vacuum back together turned it on and whooosh the hair and stuff got sucked right through.  I opened it all back up again and sure enough the hose was clear.</p>

<p>So the pen I remember vacuuming like 2 months ago.  I looked for it in the tube proper but the vacuum was till sucking at the time so I figured I didn't actually vacuum the pen but instead had imagined it!</p>

<p>I spent some time cleaning the brush which like all good roller brushes was covered with hair and string, and then I put the vacuum back together, retraced my steps and well i'm back in love with my Dyson.   The amount of stuff it sucked up was amazing.</p>

<p>Lesson learned - when you see a pen get sucked into a vacuum don't assume your seeing things, when you vacuum doesn't seem to be sucking as well as it had, don't assume its just getting older.</p>

<p>File this one under stupid Lori Tricks…</p>
