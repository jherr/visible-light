		<p>I've been a bad blogger of late.  No excuse really - just haven't felt much like sharing.  Though we've had some great stories to share, like how Megan told everyone at school the other day while they were lining up and fighting over who would be first in line - "Guys Guys, it doesn't matter whose first - we are all the same!"</p>

<p>Or how she's been singing fairly non-stop of late, mostly Beauty and the Beast songs but she's thrown in a little "Short Skirt and Long Jacket" from Cake.</p>

<p>I could have also shared how we've been doing Themed dinners before Poker night, tonight is German, Last week was Spain, and the week before was France.  The dinners have turned out really lovely.  For France I made Beef Burgundy which was extremely labor intensive, but supper yummy.  Spain I marinated Chicken and grilled it served with Saffron Rice.  Jack has been doing desserts - for France he made Profiteroles and for Spain Lovely super thin pancakes with an Orange sauce.</p>

<p>I could also blog about how last week I had incredibly good cards at Poker night - for the first few hours I just couldn't loose - I was up to 50 Bucks at one point.  But in the end of the night I was back down to a nice 35 - 25 over my buy in!</p>

<p>Gee is loving her sculpting and cooking classes.  Jack put together a swing set last week - one of those big wooden ones.  Oh and we installed a new low-flow toilet in Megan's bathroom which she loves showing people.  It uses 1.6 gallons of water as opposed to our old one  that used 7 gallons.  Even if you occasionally have to flush twice the water savings are great.</p>

<p>I'll try to be a better blogger, but honestly my mood has to improve.  I've been a little off lately, kind of sad with no apparent reason.</p>
