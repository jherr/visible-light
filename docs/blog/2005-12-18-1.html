	<title>Late night... – Visible Light</title>
	<meta name="description" content="<p>Its after midnight and i don't feel tired.  I didn't even had caffeine tonight!  But I did use the time for good and finish up my holiday cards.  … yes dear friend I who bragged a month ago about getting all my nieces and nephew gifts in the mail, have procrastinated on doing cards,  and the reason is a good one… I wanted a better picture of Megan for the card (for why do we have children if not to adorn our xmas cards!) , and our good camera is in the shop for repairs. The sad part is if your at the beginning of my list (family mostly) you got a nice note, a hand written (in my chicken scratch) note about how we are doing and that Jack has 3 books published.  If however you were one of my later cards than you got nothing.  I did spit on the back of the envelope, but my hand cramped and I just let the generic greeting that shutterfly let me put on each card suffice.</p>

<p>I played a few games of gammon, one 3 good matches and then lost 2 so I quit that, since it tends to balance out.. there is no hope for my next game, so I quit that and then I paid a few bills.</p>

<p>Its raining heavily.  I have so wanted rain.  California is great for its sun, except when you've had months on end of endless sunny day and then you'd give anything for rain.  When the hills are green I feel relaxed, feel at home, but by the end of summer the hills are brown and i'm ready to move.  I hope the rain continues for a few days, though I just checked and Its suppose to pass tonight.</p>
