		<p>3 Days here is probably a bit much but it means we can really take it easy.  If only we'd come a week later there would be so much more to do.  The Eastern part of the Rim Road isn't open yet (due to snow removal) and the boat tours don't start until next week - though I doubt I could handle the steep hike back up from the water (let alone down into it).</p>

<p>Megan slept in, waking well after 8 am.  We had a relaxing breakfast in our room, before heading up the mountain, first to the ranger station for more post cards and stamps, and then on up further to the rim Village.  We wondered around and were in place waiting for a Ranger Talk that started at 11.  The Ranger talks I've experienced at the parks have been so wonderful.  3 different - the guy in grand canyon was hysterical, the Ranger lead hike in Yosemite was delightful, and today the young woman who told us the history of the volcano and subsequent lake was animated and so entertaining.  Definitely worth it - these people obviously love their jobs.    (we plan on seeing another one tomorrow afternoon since we have the time).</p>

<p>After we headed over to the lodge to have lunch.  This lodge has nothing on the Yosemite Awehanee Lodge restaurant.  For the outrageous price, my burger was just average, and the service was less then stellar.  My original intent was eat there again tomorrow night, but Megan and I agreed we enjoyed the cafe by the cabin much better (and for the price its worth it).</p>

<p><img src="/images/assets/IMG_1510-thumb-600x450-38.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We wondered around and discovered we had actual cell phone bars near the lodge so we managed a call to Jack.  Then we headed back up to the Village info center before heading to the car and taking the west rim drive.  We stopped in several places to look out at the lake and at one point manage to park in shade so we set up our camp chairs, and sketched a bit before the mosquitos chased us back into the car.</p>

<p>And that's it - We've basically seen Crater Lake.  Its amazing but I planned way to many days here.      Tomorrow my plan is to head out of the park slightly the way we came and check out a water fall that I saw a sign for.  Hopefully the hike is reasonable.</p>

<p>Our night was quiet - we napped, ate cup of noodles and watched Trek.  <br /></p>
