	<title>Friends like me – Visible Light</title>
	<meta name="description" content="<p>This past tuesday night I went out with a couple of mom friends of mine.  We did dinner and then headed over to the local mega-plex to see a film.  We'd planned on seeing  <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lucky_number_slevin/">Lucky number sleven</a>  instead.  Now my friend Kari doesn't care for dramas or violence so I was surprised she agreed to see this particular film.  She's the reason I usually see every comedy that comes out.  Anyway she was all for it until we approached to buy our tickets.  I was first in line so while I was getting my ticket she asked the gril from behind me if "Sleven" was a comedy or not.  I looked at the girl with big eyes and mouthed "Please tell her YES"  well the girl did one better and was so convincing that Kari's fears were laid to rest until the opening credits when 3 people are murdered and very violently too.</p>

		<p>This past tuesday night I went out with a couple of mom friends of mine.  We did dinner and then headed over to the local mega-plex to see a film.  We'd planned on seeing  <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lucky_number_slevin/">Lucky number sleven</a>  instead.  Now my friend Kari doesn't care for dramas or violence so I was surprised she agreed to see this particular film.  She's the reason I usually see every comedy that comes out.

<p>She watched the whole movie and in the end enjoyed it, but when I told her at the end that the reason the girl lied was I begged her too - I think she wanted to kill me.</p>
