		<p>How is it that its been 8 years since you left us?  I feel as though it was only a few days ago, and yet I can't seem to remember your voice.  Your words are easy, I have cards hidden all over my house with your words, and your hands - i have your hands complete with the little patch of 4 dark hairs above my wrist, even your smell I can conjure - a cross between Shalimar and Hallmark.. . But oh how I wished i'd thought to record your voice.</p>

<p>I think what makes your death still so hard now is that I grieve that you have missed out on all those wonderful grand kids. Megan is really the joy of my life, and every milestone I have wanted to share with you.</p>

<p>This time of year I always think of you more and more, not because this is the time you died, but because you always made the holidays so special, When I think about my childhood, most memories that come to the front are of various Christmases with us all around the tree, me passing out the gifts - a whole days spent sharing.  It was so magical.  You always made it so.</p>

<p>Now I get to bring that Magic to my own daughter, and I look back and use your example for guidance.  Though I won't be wasting precious stocking space with fruit from the fruit bowl!</p>

<p>Mom, I miss you and I wish so often that you were just a phone call away - That I could call and tell you the latest funny from Megan, or get your advice on some mysterious medical ailment.</p>

<p><img src="/visible-light/images/assets/sc0395c439.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This picture, though of I time I don't remember, reminds me how much you loved life.  Also I feel how much love you had for us all, and how special you made me feel.  I had fun with you, scouting malls to find the real Santa, playing games - you were always up for a game.  (Mom I have a  daughter who loves games as well!), going to Disney. How many wonderful private moments we shared.</p>

<p>Its gotten easier, being with out you.  Megan is so much life, so much excitement and smiles.  She is the reason I know you loved us all so much.</p>

<p>I love you too Mom.  More than words can say.
Lori</p>
