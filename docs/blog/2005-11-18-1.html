First we headed down the new children's zoo which really is down a very big hill from the parking lot.  We played around there and all sorts of neat creatures.  Instead of feeding goats and sheep like most zoos they let you brush and curry comb them- Megan managed to get every single goat in the pen and loved every second.</p>

		<p>Megan and I joined our playgroup at the Oakland zoo today.  We really had a blast.  First we headed down the new children's zoo which really is down a very big hill from the parking lot.  We played around there and all sorts of neat creatures.  Instead of feeding goats and sheep like most zoos they let you brush and curry comb them- Megan managed to get every single goat in the pen and loved every second.</p>

<p>We then had a quick lunch (after a hike back up the hill) before heading to the rides area where we all enjoyed the carrousel, Train, and cars (car's on a track that go around in a circle).  Then everyone else bugged out but Megan and I went back into the zoo and headed up the hill the other direction to check out all the big game.  We saw Elephants, Lions, Giraffes, along with various deer and zebra.  But there was something about the day, and whole experience.  This was our first trip in a few months and since then Megan has had a language explosion.  So this was my first trip with a truly talkative and inquisitive Megan.  It really just added a whole new dimension and was just too cool.</p>

<p>We ended the day with Megan caring a bunch of long reeds that she'd picked up on the ground and she told me on the way home how she was going to use them to make a giraffes tail cause she was going to be a giraffe for halloween!</p>
