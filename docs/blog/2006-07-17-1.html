		<p>I can't believe I haven't blog since July 3rd.  So much has gone on but I just haven't had the energy to sit down and type it all out.</p>

<p>July 4th was a nice quiet day.  We went to the pool, we had a bbq and we all climbed into the jacquizzi to watch our neighbors set off illegal fireworks.  I ended up having to sleep with Megan that night for the first time since she was a baby because the fireworks freaked her out a bit, but by the next night I was being kicked out and sent to my own room.</p>

<p>Megan has finished swim class and graduated from Level 1 which means next summer she'll be in Level 2 and she only going to be 4!  she really is a great swimmer.  I've discovered a gymnastics day camp program through the Little Gym in Newark so she gets to do that a couple of days a week and I get about 6 hours to myself during the week.  Its a great trade off and actually comes out cheaper than preschool.  She gets an art project, and 2 hours in the gym with some free play and some structured games.  She also gets a snack.  Each day when I pick her up she is pooped and sleeps well that night so overall a great success.</p>

<p>I spent most of last week getting ready for Jack's birthday party on Saturday.  I decided to cater the whole thing myself and had some great successes.  I made Tequila Lime Chicken and Portabellas for vegetarians.  A Pasta Salad, a asian slaw, and a green salad, all with different veggies from the garden.  Home made bread rolls, some home roasted nuts and For dessert we had 2 kinds of cupcakes, a box mix white and a from scratch chocolate ganache that were super yummy.</p>

<p>Now i'm getting ready for our trip on Sunday to South Carolina for a reunion on Jack's side of the family, and when we return I'll be getting ready for my dad to visit.  by Mid-august we'll be able to take a breather, get in some beach time and wait till school starts in September.</p>
