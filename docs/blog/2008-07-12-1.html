	<title>Very satisfying... – Visible Light</title>
	<meta name="description" content="<p>Tonight at 6, we just started wondering about what was for dinner.  Jack's been under the weather the last couple of days so I didn't want to just make anything - I wanted to see what he felt like.  He decided he could do Pasta, so I agreed.  I went out to the garden to get some tomatoes for a salad and some basil for the sauce.   Our Basil is amazing - due to our heat wave - its really been taking off. We're usually so cool that we don't get huge basil plants.  Anyway - I picked a whole branch and headed in.  I didn't really feel like tomato sauce.  So I decided I'd make pesto for me and mix the pesto with some tomato sauces for Jack and Megan.  I had Jack pick some more tomatoes so I could mix them in with the pesto  and pasta for me - and wow - so yummy.  Jack and Megan gobbled up their dinner to so I think we had a winner.    I have a whole jar of pesto in the fridge left over too - yum</p>
