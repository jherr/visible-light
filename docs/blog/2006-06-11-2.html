	<meta name="description" content="<p>I had my film club today - let me first tell you that I got an email from the clubs director informing me that San Jose was having a gay pride parade and parking would be scarce - so arrive early.  I drove down at 11:30 - show time is 2.  I got down by noon and well the parade was long over and everything was cleaned up.  Downtown seemed almost diserted. Since i'd had a big breakfast with Jack and Megan this morning, I wasn't really in the mood for lunch.  I decided to just walk around Down Town San Jose.  First I found a drug store and managed to waste alittle time there.  Then walking further I found the  <a href="http://www.sjmusart.org/">San Jose Museum of Art</a> .   Well still having over an hour and half to kill I decided to wonder on in.  I really enjoyed myself.  Though I can honestly say i'm not a hugh fan of "modern" art, I did enjoy seeing all the different pieces.  And I took my time, figuring I could come back next film club if I didn't see it all, but as it turned out the museum is small and I did.</p>

		<p>I had my film club today - let me first tell you that I got an email from the clubs director informing me that San Jose was having a gay pride parade and parking would be scarce - so arrive early.

<p>On To Film Club…</p>

<p>Today's movie was  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0771493/">Richard Schiff </a> its a hot button film that will have you cringing and still walking away thinking.  It's a film that will stick with you.  Not sure when it will open as they haven't found a distributor for it yet.</p>

<p>After the film we were lucky enough to enjoy a question and answer session with Peter Krause.  He did tell us they still had a bit of editing they wished to do, and he clarified or rather explained the purpose of one aspect of the ending which I found a little clichÃ© before his explanation.  It was a rare treat to get to talk with an actor I so dearly enjoy the work of.   I suspect he will always be  <a href="http://www.hbo.com/sixfeetunder/"> Nate Fisher </a> for me.</p>

<p>I came home to a lovely home made dinner by Jack and a cuddly Megan who is fighting a cold.
All in all, not a bad way to spend a day.</p>
