		<p>We had a really great weekend.  Josephine came over and spent the night saturday - she and Megan played until they both passed out and slept soundly through sunday morning.  I didn't realize Jack was having such a time breathing, so I let him pamper me despite the whole no breathing thing. I'm glad he is feeling better now and has been to the doctor.</p>

<p>We enjoyed Mini Golf and Go-karts with the girls, in the morning and then Pam and Yvonne joined us for a bbq before they all headed home.</p>

<p>Monday I was back at the pool and Cooking for our Poker crew.  I also have been working on planning our trip to San Francisco which Jack and I are taking for our 15th anniversary.  Before that I'm going to Vegas with a mom friend and have been busy planning that as well.  This weekend we're going to camp with a bunch of families I know for a night - they are staying 2 but 1 is a good start for us.</p>

<p>The ugh in the title refers to the fact that I have yet another cold - this makes 5 in 5 months!  I'm so tired of being stuffy and achy.  I can't believe that i've had more colds since I started getting healthier.  It makes absolutely no sense.  So I skipped  the pool this morning and ran some errands.</p>

<p>I'll end on a cute Megan story.  Last night while we were cuddling in her bed, and singing songs, I sang to her, as I often do, "You are my sunshine"  about half way through she tried to interrupt me and I prevented her saying Let me finish.  When I was done I asked her what she wanted to say and she said….</p>

<p>"Mom - why do you sing a song about me being your Son when I'm your Daughter?!"</p>
