	<title>More Art... – Visible Light</title>
	<meta name="description" content="<p>I'm teaching my 4th Art lesson tomorrow to Megan's class.  I can't tell you enough how rewarding this program has been for me.  The kids are so excited to be doing something different and they are so excited when they see me there on a day that's not my usual day.  This month we are playing with texture and doing collages.  I went over this afternoon and set up for the morning, with lots of different textures in  baskets on each desk.    Now I just need to read over the prints and familiarize myself with them all.  I also want to collect a few things to pass around that are different textures.  Megan and I cleaned a muddy rock off from the front yard that was in the mud - its nice and smooth and perfect for that - but I need a few rocks that are jagged too.  I wish i'd saved the pine cones from our christmas decorations.</p>
