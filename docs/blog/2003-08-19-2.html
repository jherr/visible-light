	<title>excitement for the morning... – Visible Light</title>
	<meta name="description" content="<p>Megan and I were out for our morning walk when I heard a car have trouble starting - it turned out to be a pick up truck and by the time I reached it, it had started.  I looked in to see the driver and noticed the small man was messing with wires under the dash.  a few steps later I realized he was stealing the truck - I thought!.  As it passed me I tried to get the license tag and I called the police.  After giving all the details I'd gathered to the dispatcher, Megan and I proceeded around the park and we were on our way back when 3 police cars came driving up.  I spoke briefly with an officer who then went to knock on doors to see if the truck belong to anyone and if it had in fact been stolen.  He said they would stop by the house if they needed more from me.  That was about an hour ago and since they haven't returned I'm guessing the car wasn't stolen and I made a mountain out of a mole hill - I'll let you all know if anything changes.</p>
