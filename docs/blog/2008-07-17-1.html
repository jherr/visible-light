		<p>Jack and I went out with friends on Monday night and enjoyed the Police with Elvis Costello who opened.  Honestly I don't know Elvis that much, the one song I knew was when Sting came out and sang with him and damn if I wasn't in line for the bathroom when that happened!</p>

<p>The concert was at  <a href="http://www.livenation.com/venue/getVenue/venueId/1022">Shoreline</a>  probably the nicest big venue concert arena.  We sat on the cheap seats or lawn seating.  Sting announced during the concert that we were 12,000 strong - which seemed a bit big to me but the web site says they can hold 22,000 so maybe he had it right.</p>

<p>We got there early and enjoyed a picnic dinner during Elvis's opening …</p>

<p>Then when the Police started - everyone stood up - here's a shot of the crowd - before dark - non of my other picks really came out (all cell phone shots)</p>

<p><img src="/visible-light/images/assets/IMG_0195.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The next morning I fully intended to wake up and blog about the concert, but I woke up not feeling my best.  I headed out though and picked up my brother David from the airport and drove with him and Megan up to SF where we had lunch at Gordon Birch on the Embarcadero before I dropped him at his hotel.  He really only had a small window to see us and as it turned out so did I.</p>

<p>By the time I got home I knew something was wrong.  I crashed and slept for 3 hours straight woke up long enough to take my temp and discover I had a 102 fever.  I lived on ginger-ale and soda crackers for the next day with violent stomach contractions and pleading for either death or at least to throw up.  But in the middle of last night the fever finally broke, and I finally managed some real food today.  I felt so great during the concert and less than 24 hours later I felt so incredibly sick - amazing how quickly  things can overwhelm.</p>
