	<title>How to freak someone (or yourself) Out – Visible Light</title>
	<meta name="description" content="<p>Jack is away at the moment and I have a hard enough time sleeping with out him here.  Last night Oso went crazy because a cat dared to cross the street at around 11:30 at night.  Once I was able to figure out what had happened and get him back to bed with me, I was eventually able to fall back asleep… then early this morning with my arm over Oso, someone tapped me on shoulder.  I was wide awake - who else could it be, Megan asleep in her crib, Jack is in SC, I jumped up out of bed, heart pounding… only to find… a balloon loosing its helium had made it all the way into my bedroom and was resting just above me - the fan was forcing it down and it would bounce off me (thus the tapping sensation).  Once I caught my heart and shoved it back in my chest, I popped that balloon and collapsed into bed… giggling!</p>
