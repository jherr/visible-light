				<p><p>So its raining again… and while this is not unusual for California in March, I'm not amused since I just had my car washed today!  Megan and I had about 30 minutes before her gym class and I had an empty gas tank so I went in for a fill up and answered yes to the car wash question.  It looked good till the sun went down!</p>

Then we headed back and explored the Splash Zone!  Megan had a wonderful time and even choose "Finding Nemo" for the ride home (having not had her fill of Fish yet).</p>

				<p><p>Sunday was my spa day.  Jack watched Gee and I headed with a friend to the  <a href="http://www.claremontresort.com/spa/default.asp">Claremont Spa</a> .  We had a wonderful day of pampering.  I enjoyed a private herbal infused bath, a pineapple and grape seed scrub, followed by a Porpalis Wrap, then I was covered in Coconut Milk.  We then had lunch in one of the hotel's restaurants, and then headed back to the Spa were I had a Massage.  The highlight would be the scrub and wrap.  I really felt like royalty.  The Massage was a little too hard and my muscles are still a little sore.  Next time I'm going to try a mud wrap and a stone massage.  The next time being for our anniversary in June (I've already got overnight siting for Megan) Jack and I are going to go for a weekend.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">26 February 2005</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I eat chicken.. I admit it.  Jack and I gave up all meat cold turkey in 1993, and were good faithful, vegetarians throughout our trip to Oz, and our move back here.  When I got pregnant with Megan in 2002 I craved Chicken so badly I actually gave in and ate a few chicken sandwiches.  I gave it up again when Megan was born and was happily reformed until I had my gallbladder out.  Basically I was running to the toilet, frantic and multiple times a day - not easy with a baby, who is demanding attention.    I remembered back to pregnancy and how the chicken had bound me up and gave it a try - sweet relief.  So now I'm a chicken eating vegetarian.  Vegetarian on most days with a few days off for some chicken relief.  I'm enjoying it all alittle too much too.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I hosted a baby shower today … for a very good Friend, Diane.  She's expecting her second, a girl… in a couple of weeks.  Her first, Scottie is one of Megan's favorite "guys" and we love hanging out together.  So I hosted her a baby shower tonight and It all worked out so well… We started at 8 pm, Megan actually was asleep by 7:30.  I made fondue, and all the other ladies brought  a dessert to share (and one mom brought cucumber sandwiches which made a great change).  We had Tiramusu, Cheese cake, Banana Cream pie, Strawberry short cake, and fruit puffs.  It was all so delicious.  I had 5 games prepared thanks to  <a href="http://baby-shower-games-etc.com/baby_shower_games.htm">this site</a> , and I actually picked games no body had played before and everyone.  Different mom's won, and everyone liked the gifts I had.  Everyone had such a good time and I did as well.</p>

				<p><p>Megan had eaten her lunch at the grocery store (Edemame) and then again when we got home (carrots, String cheese and a fortune cookie), while I put the groceries away.  So I set her up drawing while I made myself a sandwich.  When I got to the table, Megan had colored her picture, her lip, her hair, her legs her feet and her cheek.  She wanted to go and wash off the marker from her hands, so I took a bite put my sandwich down and helped her to the sink.  As we cleaned I realized she had produced an odor so I picked her up, carried her back, changed her diaper, wiped the marker off exposed body parts and got her in clothes she can't remove for her impending nap.  When I'd gotten back to the table.. my sandwich was gone - completely gone - dogs no where to be found!  (ok they were in the bay window acting guilty and licking their lips.)</p>
