	<title>Morning update .. First sleepover – Visible Light</title>
	<meta name="description" content="<p>The girls got up and found Jack who was getting ready for work.  So he got them set up with Megan's v-tech game and that's where I found them a bit later.  I had no idea they were up, till Jack told me, and that was 20 minutes later at least.  But both got dressed easy and had breakfast.  It was a relatively quiet night,  and thankfully Megan didn't have the night terrors she occasionally has.</p>

		<p>The girls got up and found Jack who was getting ready for work.  So he got them set up with Megan's v-tech game and that's where I found them a bit later.  I had no idea they were up, till Jack told me, and that was 20 minutes later at least.  But both got dressed easy and had breakfast.  It was a relatively quiet night,  and thankfully Megan didn't have the night terrors she occasionally has.</p>

<p>After I shower and change we'll be off to drop Megan off at school and then Josephine and I will run some errands.  I was thinking of another picnic at the farm but the rain clouds mean thats out of the questions so we'll just come back here after we pick Megan up and have lunch and then the girls can play until Josephine's mom comes or dinner - which ever comes first :)</p>

<p>Update:  After dropping Megan off at school, Josephine and I headed off to Trader Joes and had a lovely time shopping.  We headed back to the house and I put all the groceries away.  Josephine entertained her self in Megan's room and after she got bored she headed up to the living room where she played with the v-tech Elmo's game.  We headed out to the hardware store and then picked up Megan.</p>

<p>After returning home and eating sandwiches. The girls played outside despite the dark clouds we still haven't had the rain.  When they came in we painted t-shirts together before heading into my room to watch a movie.  The girls are there now - all bundled up in the bed drinking chocolate milk and watching "Monster's Inc"</p>
