		<p>I've seen 3 movies in the last 4 days. And that doesn't include the remake of " Inherit the wind" which Jack and I watched on TV tonight, or Nicolas cage in Lord of War which we watched over the weekend. (both of these I loved though Lord of War actually made me put my laptop down and pay attention)</p>

<p>First on saturday after attending a baby shower (for my lovely friend Simone - Congrats Simone &amp; Marty)  I went and saw <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/waitress/">The Waitress</a>  which I enjoyed though feel the build up of 90% on rotten tomatoes kind of meant it would disappoint - though not much.  I think my biggest disappointment came with Nathan Fillion who I loved in Firefly, but I didn't really care for him in this - guess I like him as a commanding Captain better.   Also finding out about the murder of the co-star/ writer, director before this movie came out and was received, but a damper on my reflection of it.    There was a big poster up as we left the theater that mentioned her murder and when I came home and read it (and realized Law and Order had already ripped it off)  I was so saddened I think it made the movie a bit more melancholy than comedy.</p>

<p>Next came Pirates which  <a href="http//www.muttmansion.com/ds">Jack</a>  has already blogged about.  I liked it more than him and was entertained, but I will say I missed the simplicity of the ride - this movie was convoluted.  And Johnny Depp's multiple personalities at first I found hysterical, but the card was over played and by the end I was annoyed each and every time they used that devise.  I would recommend it for Pirates fans and hell I'll probably see any other Pirate movie Disney wants to throw out.  I will also say I'm annoyed Jack didn't tell me about the scene after the credits until we were crossing the street to go back to the car and he knew about it! - I would have sat there and waited for it had I known.  He assured me I could find it on the net but I've had no luck there.  If you go  - wait for it.  I will say also that it was not worth the money paid to the sitter given that it was something short of 3 hours, on top of the over inflated movie prices.</p>

<p>Today I took Megan to see Shrek 3 and i have to say I loved it as much as I loved the first.  The humor was geared towards me though Megan seemed to love it just as much (even the second time around).  I was kind of disappointed with 2 - its seemed flat, but 3 was just hoot and I enjoyed trying to figure out who did which  voice and I loved the moment when the queen (played by Julie Andrews) hummed Raindrops on Roses!  best of the 3rd movies in a series i've seen.</p>

<p>Guess I recommend them all - take that for what you will.</p>
