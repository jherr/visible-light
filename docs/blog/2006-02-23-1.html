	<meta name="description" content="<p>When my mom was sick, while having different things done to her, she would hold my hand.  That was when I first started to hate my wedding band.  Jack and I had picked our bands out of a guys garage in Miami, actually he was a retired jeweler who still had alittle inventory to move.  We got great deals on 2 bands, Jack's was convex and mine was concave.  I figured it was neat that mine fit in his, even though they didn't match.</p>

		<p>When my mom was sick, while having different things done to her, she would hold my hand.  That was when I first started to hate my wedding band.  Jack and I had picked our bands out of a guys garage in Miami, actually he was a retired jeweler who still had alittle inventory to move.  We got great deals on 2 bands, Jack's was convex and mine was concave.  I figured it was neat that mine fit in his, even though they didn't match.</p>

<p>Well cut to years later and i've repeatedly had cuts on my hands from the ring, but it wasn't until Mom was sick, and said to me - why do you keep waring a ring that causes pain - and  that made me want a new ring.</p>

<p>I've tried different rings over time, but nothing really felt right so i'd end up back with the concave one.  So I recently just started going with out - but this bugged me too.  Well today I went to Macy's 50% off jewelry sale and bought my self a beautiful solid gold band.  nothing fancy, but not painful either.  and so now I feel married again (ok not really - a ring doesn't make the marriage - but it sure helps).</p>
