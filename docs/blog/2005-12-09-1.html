At the time I never made a meal without meat, so in the beginning it was a challenge.  But giving up a whole food group basically opened up our taste-buds to alot of possibilities.  I now eat lots of veggies I thought I hated, including Brussels sprouts, Spinach, mushrooms (raw only still can't stand cooked ones) and eggplant.  It also opened me up to different cuisines, like Indian.  I now love a good curry.

		<p>When Jack and I decided to become vegetarians in 1993, we were both fairly meat and potatoes sort of people.  At the time I never made a meal without meat, so in the beginning it was a challenge.  But giving up a whole food group basically opened up our taste-buds to alot of possibilities.  I now eat lots of veggies I thought I hated, including Brussels sprouts, Spinach, mushrooms (raw only still can't stand cooked ones) and eggplant.  It also opened me up to different cuisines, like Indian.  I now love a good curry.  In Australia we used to go to a  <a href="http://www.melbournechinatown.com.au/dining/dining_Gaylord.html">Gaylord's</a>  hidden in China Town.</p>

<p>When we moved here I was stoked… with such a large growing <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/05/24/MN222096.DTL">Indian Population</a>   We were bound to find some incredible restaurants.  The truth however is that every restaurant we've tried is way to spicy for me, even when I order mild I can't seem to eat the food brought.</p>

<p>When Megan was first born I was told she was allergic to dairy and since she was only breast feeding it meant i had to give up all diary.  I was really craving for Indian and since there is alot of diary in it, I decided to try my hand at making it.  I used goats milk and made paneer (indian cheese) and then I cooked a couple of dishes.  But in reality it was a bit of work and as Megan got older making my own cheese, seemed too time consuming.  So we relied on the other cuisine of yummy curry - thai.  After a while, we found ourselves eating alot of pasta and pizza, and japanese, because that was something Megan would eat,   Ok so what is the food history all about?</p>

<p>Well  <a href="http://www.wondersky.com/deepscookbook/2000712221255.htm">Matar Paneer</a>  (Peas), with Yellow rice and some naan.  I started at 6 and everything was on the table by 6:40 - almost qualified for Rachel Ray!</p>

<p>The best part was it was yummy.  I left out most of the chilies, so it wasn't spicy, and  as usual I didn't follow the recipes exactly but I used them as a general idea.  (Case in point - i didn't make the spinach paste - instead opting for putting fresh leaves in the sauce and letting them cook down)  I also never bothered to measure  amounts ingredients (except for the rice).</p>
