		<p>Yesterday while at Costco, I joked and chatted with an older couple.  We laughed at how hard it was to push a cart with the free cup of HOT coffee in one hand.  A few isles later, I recommended one brand of this item to them and they took my advice and thanked me.  We even checked out through the same check stand.   By the end of the trip we were fast becoming friends.</p>

<p>They checked out just ahead of me and as I approached my car I had a giggle that we were actually parked next to one another - I shouted out a laugh and a howdy.  They ignored me.  wondering why I looked at the back of their truck and read several mean spirited anti liberal bumper stickers - including one that told me I should leave their country with  and take my "Liberal Change" with me.</p>

<p>My car is also plaster with bumper stickers-  I have a "Proud to be a Democrat", a "God save me from your followers" and 2 Obama stickers.  Nothing that condemns them though as that is not my nature.</p>

<p>As I got in my car I told them both to have a great holiday and smiled broadly.  They both with eyes down didn't even acknowledge me.</p>

<p>I would never have guessed their behavior change judging by their friendly demeanor in the store. I hope I gave them something to think about.<br /></p>
