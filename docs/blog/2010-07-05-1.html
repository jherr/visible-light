		<p>We managed to pull out of the Crater Lake Park by 8:30 am and stopped in Klamath Falls to pick up provisions for camping in Lassen.  I don't know if the sun was shining brighter or what but Klamath Falls looked better then before.  We did drive out a differant way because we were heading to Lava Beds.</p>

<p>Oh Lava Beds was amazing.  3 days in Crater Lake was too much but 1 in Lava Beds wasn't nearly enough.  I really want to go back again.</p>

<p>We arrived at 11, and when I say arrived, we actually turned off the highway and and had to drive down a very poorly maintained road for what seemed like ever, and yet when we turned the right turn into the Park suddenly the roads were improved.  We came in the North exit and it took a while to drive and get to the Entrance Station, and flash our new Annual Pass to the National Parks.</p>

<p>Then we had another long drive to get to the visitor center - though we had to stop at one point to see all the dried black lava rock that had oozed out of the volcano and over the landscape.  Because it was such a think dense rock it actually didn't get far, but it devestated the landscape just the same and was amazing to see.</p>

<p><img src="/visible-light/images/assets/IMG_1542-thumb-600x450-59.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once at the Visitor center we picked up tickets for a 1:30 tour and a Jr Ranger Book, before heading back the way we came a little way to picnic at the splatter cones.  After lunch we explored the splatter cones which are exactly as they sound - small chimney vents that splatter up lava at some point.  One was said to be more then 50 feet deep.</p>

<p><img src="/visible-light/images/assets/IMG_1550-thumb-300x225-65.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We headed back to the visitor center and with time to spare we first drove around the cave loop and then parked and explored Mosh Pit Cave - the only Lava tub cave that has had lights added.</p>

<p><img src="/visible-light/images/assets/IMG_1556-thumb-300x225-68.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Back at the visitor center we borrowed a flashlight and bought new helmets because the tour required both and then we met the ranger at the Valentine cave.</p>

<p>It was something to be hold.  Megan and I willingly (along with 22 people) walked into and then followed a ranger deep into a Lava Tube.  Once well inside the Ranger informed us that the last erruption there was 900 years ago and that the Volcano was dormant and not extinct.  This created such a panic in me that I can't explain, however the calm spit fire ranger helped alleve my fears and I did finish the tour.<br />
?Imagine walking in the dark over dried ripples of lava stone, ducking to avoid Lavacycles, and seeing shelfs of lava dried along on the way where evidence of different flows left there mark.  I was so overwhelmed with awe and trepidation.  I had to wonder what would posses people to explore tubes where lava once flowed and could again someday and then I realized I was such a person - shutter.</p>

<p><img src="/visible-light/images/assets/IMG_1558-thumb-600x800-74.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After the tour we headed over to another cave called Skull Cave  (named for the skulls of animals and people found there) but by now we were pretty whiped out and after making the intial desent into the cave we took a few pictures and then headed back out. (sorry no photos of me in my hard hat.)</p>

<p><img src="/visible-light/images/assets/IMG_1559-thumb-300x225-77.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Last on our agenda was to get Megan Jr Rangered.  So we found a quiet corner of the Museum and she finished her  booklet while I dozed and watch a video about the creation of the National Monument and about the battles fought there against the Modac Indians.</p>

<p>We left at 4 and the GPS informed us that we had 4 more hours of driving time before we would reach our <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/239/1130994/restaurant/Northern-California/La-Cocinita-Fall-River-Mills">Mexican Restaurant</a>  that hit the spot, pulling in to the campground in time to check in and jump in the pool before unpacking into the cabin (Camping is a very misnomer - we have A/C and a tv fridge and microwave in the cabin).</p>

<p>I was so tired from the day that I actually didn't write this until after Day 6 which is our trip to Lassen.
