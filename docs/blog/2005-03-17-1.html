	<title>sleepless night – Visible Light</title>
	<meta name="description" content="<p>Megan woke up crying at 2am.  I thinking it was later got her and brought her to bed with me where she immediately stopped crying.  Too tired to argue I did the best I could to pile pillows around her and figured we could just sleep together until I realized some 10 mins later that I couldn't sleep worried that if I did she'd roll out of the bed - the guest bed is an old rope bed, that I have to climb up onto myself.  The Fall for Megan would be terrible.  So I pick her up which wakes her and I hold her telling her she has to go back to her bed.  She started crying so I told her I'd hold her till she falls asleep, but that Mommy can't sleep until she's back in her bed and mommy needs to sleep.  She snuggled in close and every so often looking longingly at the space on the bed she just vacated.</p>

		<p>Megan woke up crying at 2am.  I thinking it was later got her and brought her to bed with me where she immediately stopped crying.  Too tired to argue I did the best I could to pile pillows around her and figured we could just sleep together until I realized some 10 mins later that I couldn't sleep worried that if I did she'd roll out of the bed - the guest bed is an old rope bed, that I have to climb up onto myself.  The Fall for Megan would be terrible.  So I pick her up which wakes her and I hold her telling her she has to go back to her bed.  She started crying so I told her I'd hold her till she falls asleep, but that Mommy can't sleep until she's back in her bed and mommy needs to sleep.  She snuggled in close and every so often looking longingly at the space on the bed she just vacated.</p>

<p>I realized I needed something to wake me up a bit so I grabbed my laptop and to do a search for a map for our drive on friday - maneuvering everything with one hand, as I'm holding Megan with the other across my lap and under her blanket.  Then I start looking at blogs  i haven't checked in a while cause their owners don't always blog, and found that  <a href="http://hyatts.org/BecBlog/">BecBlog</a>  is getting updated from New Zealand where they are currently traveling.  Its a great read and gets me through the next 20 mins.  When I then finally put Megan in her own bed she wakes up screaming so I snuck out of the room and am now hiding in the living room waiting for her to fall back asleep.  She's quiet now but I don't dare rush back in there.  i'm guessing i'll be needing a nap again today.</p>
