	<title>Update – Visible Light</title>
	<meta name="description" content="<p>We're still amazingly busy, but i have time for an update.  Megan and I had a lovely 2 days in Mendocino.  We stayed at a B&amp;B which while nice had a disappointing breakfast  - Nothing home made or really fresh!  Jack and I have stayed in several b&amp;b's over the years, including one in Tasmania called "Squirrels in the park"  Run by 2 expat brits who made us not only a wonderful breakfast but made us dinner the night before when we arrived in town with no dinner plans on a major holiday - nothing was open!.  So I was disappointed, but Megan had fun.</p>

		<p>We're still amazingly busy, but i have time for an update.  Megan and I had a lovely 2 days in Mendocino.  We stayed at a B&amp;B which while nice had a disappointing breakfast  - Nothing home made or really fresh!  Jack and I have stayed in several b&amp;b's over the years, including one in Tasmania called "Squirrels in the park"  Run by 2 expat brits who made us not only a wonderful breakfast but made us dinner the night before when we arrived in town with no dinner plans on a major holiday - nothing was open!.  So I was disappointed, but Megan had fun.</p>

<p>We drove back and stopped at a farm stand picking up peaches freshly picked and ripe, corn that was just picked and so delicious!  We also stopped at  <a href="http://www.atlasofwineries.com/wineries/scharffenberger.html">a winery </a>  where I picked up a really wonderful Zin, and another bottle of white we haven't had yet.  We stopped in El Cerrito on the way home and had dinner with friends.</p>

<p>Jack and I tried going to differant movies last sunday - He and Megan saw  Underdog  while I watched  Becoming Jane .</p>

<p>The week was filled with lots of activities, including a trip to the zoo, and Ikea.  Megan also had gymnastics camp, Dance class and Sculpting class.</p>

<p>Today I'm going to film club and then heading down to Santa Cruz to have dinner at a friends bday party.  Tuesday we head to Denver for a couple of days with my sister, before Megan starts kindergarten - NEXT WEEK!</p>

<p>On the kindergarten front she has a new backpack and we got her class assignments.  She'll be attending afternoon kindergarten which starts at 11:25 so i'll be feeding her breakfast and lunch in the mornings!  It also means no more sculpting class because they only offer it monday afternoons and she'll have to move to the monday afternoon dance class. I've got to figure out our nature class schedule too since really only Tuesday afternoons are open.</p>

<p>I'm not going to enroll her in a lot of extra stuff since school is 5 days a week.</p>
