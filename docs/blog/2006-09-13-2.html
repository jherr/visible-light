	<title>Boingy Boingy Boingy Bing... Or my Dora Rant – Visible Light</title>
	<meta name="description" content="<p>Megan has this Dora book… that I loath.  It not just that each time we're back into story books (and not reading chapter books) she picks it out, its that the whole story is beyond ridiculous.  The premise is that Dora must become a true princess in order to save Boots who has fallen under a sleeping spell.  Fine I get it and I know that that is why Megan loves the book because she wants to be a True Princess.  But what absolutely kills me each time I read it is that the 4 tests that Dora must do to become a true princess are so stupid.  The first is find a red ring in a dragons cave - ok not so bad I'll let that one slide, the second is teach giant sleeping rocks to sing.  Even that one I can slide - but the last too are turning Winter to spring and bringing the moon down to a king and queen are just wrong- she's not trying to be a god she's trying to be a princess - what does taming seasons or moving celestial objects have to do with that.</p>

		<p>Megan has this Dora book… that I loath.  It not just that each time we're back into story books (and not reading chapter books) she picks it out, its that the whole story is beyond ridiculous.  The premise is that Dora must become a true princess in order to save Boots who has fallen under a sleeping spell.  Fine I get it and I know that that is why Megan loves the book because she wants to be a True Princess.  But what absolutely kills me each time I read it is that the 4 tests that Dora must do to become a true princess are so stupid.  The first is find a red ring in a dragons cave - ok not so bad I'll let that one slide, the second is teach giant sleeping rocks to sing.  Even that one I can slide - but the last too are turning Winter to spring and bringing the moon down to a king and queen are just wrong- she's not trying to be a god she's trying to be a princess - what does taming seasons or moving celestial objects have to do with that.</p>

<p>I actually love Dora, The show is cute and Megan has picked up a few good things from watching it.  Most of the books are helpful - like the one about Dora going to the dentist - Megan and I have been reading it to prepare for her trip at the end of the month - but this true princess one - come on people give Dora tasks that are slightly credible cause we have little girls out here in the real world who want to become "True Princesses!"</p>

<p>I'm going to get Megan in to another chapter book cause I need a break from this darn book.</p>
