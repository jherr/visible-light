I know i'd gained muscle and stamina, I have also lost clothing sizes,  but the lbs which is all I care about really - no matter what I said - they were staying put.  Well taking a page from Jack, and my friend Malai who works out 2 times a day, I started adding a second work out some days.  So my schedule is now</p>

		<p>On just swimming a mile 3 - 4  times a week I was maintaining my weight.  I know i'd gained muscle and stamina, I have also lost clothing sizes,  but the lbs which is all I care about really - no matter what I said - they were staying put.  Well taking a page from Jack, and my friend Malai who works out 2 times a day, I started adding a second work out some days.  So my schedule is now</p>

<p>Swim a mile Monday, Wed, Friday and either Tuesday or thursday depending on Jack's schedule, and also add hike, cardio dvd, or elliptical in the afternoon.  Well that seems to have started the trick - i'm down 3 Kilos in the last week. - Yes friends we have a kilo scale thanks to our years in Australia.  I've recently bought a lb scale so i'll know that number too.</p>

<p>And best of all is that I am feeling really good, I'm sleeping more soundly at night, drifting off with out any sort of sleep aid, and a lot of my aches and pains are much less.</p>

<p>My lower back pain too was helped by going to  <a href="http://www.brasforbodyandsoul.org/">Bras for Body and Soul</a>  and getting sized.  Man what a difference to have great support!  I basically went into a fitting room with a woman who brought me 15 or so different bras after taking my measurements.  I bought 3 different ones and love them all.  It was really a great experience, one i'll repeat as I continue to lose weight.</p>

<p>ADDITIONAL:  I got a request as to what the dvd is I"m doing… Follow the  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Body-Beginning-Workouts-Weight/dp/B0002PUDPA/sr=1-2/qid=1170311190/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/104-1331082-2707136?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd">Link</a></p>
