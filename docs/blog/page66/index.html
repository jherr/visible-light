				<p><p>Megan cut her own hair.  I found a small clump the other day and when she was confronted with it she said yes she had but it was such a small clump I let it slide with the warning of don't do it again.  Today before Dance class I tried to french braid it and found much of the hair was too short to reach the back.  I asked her did she cut more hair and she said no she had not.  I gave up and did a pony tail with a bit of hairspray to help the sides.  But then… while cleaning up I found the pile of cut hair and I realized she really went at it.  I looked more closely and saw she'd whacked her bangs and her sides.  So we headed off to the local children's hair place and got the nice lady there to even it all out.</p>

				<p><p>I took Megan to see a local High school production of Beauty and the Beast yesterday - the same one Jack took her too a week ago.  We stopped and bought a bunch of flowers on the way and after the play Megan gave them to Belle.  I think Megan was a bit disappointed that the girl who played Belle didn't remember her, but its not surprising given how many little girls were vying for her attention.  As for the play it was well done for a highschool production.  It was a tad long and some of the performers seemed out of sorts.  My favorite was Lumiere and while Jack went on and on about Gaston, I did think he did a good job but the kid gave me the creeps.  Probably means his performance was spot on - just not my favorite.</p>

They include "Vote Against Hate in 2008", "Marriage is â™¥ + â™¥" and one about Bush's legacy - you know Death Deficit and Deceit.   My favorite sticker is "God Please save me from your followers"</p>

				<p><p>I did finally go to the doctor last thursday.  She gave me an inhaler, cough drug and antibiotics.  I am feeling better, but I still am coughing a lot.  So much that last night I had to stop eating dinner.  I made chili that was way to spicy for me and wow I couldn't stop coughing.</p>

				<p><p>No i didn't go to the doctor - probably should but what are they going to say - I'm now at the dry unproductive annoying cough stage.  I managed to get to the pool this morning and I swam 2 lengths before I gave up because of excessive coughing and just used the kick board and kicked for 20 mins.  then I got out and soaked in the hot tub.  It felt ok but not wonderful.  Last night I managed to do yoga and not cough much.  My friend has a bi-weekly yoga night at her house and I went and really enjoyed myself.  I hope to continue going.</p>
