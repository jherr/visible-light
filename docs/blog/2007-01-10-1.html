		<p>When we went to visit Grandpa and Mumsie, Megan and I slept in the same bed.  We'd done it once before on July 4th when the fireworks scared her.  Before that just she slept with me and Jack for the first few weeks and that was it.  She just hasn't been all that keen on having anyone else in her bed.  Not her mom, Dad, or dogs.  Even her friend Josephine who spends the night gets told to stay on her sleeping bag.</p>

<p>So my usual game at night is to pretend to fall asleep.  She says no and tells me to get out.  Tonight I told her I get to sleep until the second song is done  (we listen to the same 2 songs every night and have for the last year or so - no changes - She won't allow it!)  So what does she do as i pretend to snore - she sings … Loudly!  She sang in my ear at the top of her lungs - giggling all through it between songs she asked… "Can you really sleep with all my singing?" needless to say I too was giggling - it was just too damn funny.</p>
