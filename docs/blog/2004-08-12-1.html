So we are going to try and get home today.  All of the east coast is socked in and atlanta is already having over 1 hr delays and that is were we are connecting to get back to Oakland… so we may be on the east coast a while longer than expected.  Hopefully we'll at least get out of tampa today as they are expecting Hurricane Charlie to make landfall right around here tomorrow.</p>

<p>I called Delta this am and after being on hold for 40 mins was told that all the older flights were over booked except one and it only had one seat (and was only 50 mins before our flight)  ah well, we shall see…</p>

<p>This morning are watching them spread rocks all over the pool deck down below.  I was hoping to get Megan in the pool to use up some energy before our flights but this pool is under construction.
we could take a shuttle to the other Marriott in town and use there pool.  Not sure I want to goto the effort.</p>
