	<meta name="description" content="<p>HBO has done it again.  First Sopranos, then Six Feet Under, now  another show that is really turning out to be one of the best on TV with superb writing and acting.  <a href="http://www.hbo.com/carnivale/?ntrack_para1=leftnav_category0_show4">Carnivale</a> , takes place during the depression in the dust bowl.  Its follows a Carni troop and tells their very mixed up stories.  This weeks episode ended a 2 parter  -SPOILER ALERT- that had the Carnivale coming to a old mining town.  There they performed for an all male audience.   The girly show was a big hit and when one of the performers stripped down all the way, the miners went nuts.  Next thing they know she's been killed and the Carni folk are seeking retribution only no one is around to give it. As they try to figure out what is going on, you realize that all the miners are dead, and they have killed the "harlot" to have a woman to entertain them in entirety.  I shudder for the girl - and this is fiction.  As they left the town they showed her image in a window being pulled back in the room by a dirty miners arm.</p>

<p>Since Jack finally is watching the episode tonight I can talk about it here.  I probably am not doing the show justice.  I like shows that really make me think  about them.</p>
