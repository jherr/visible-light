		<p>This recent plan by the house to cut Planned Parenthoods funding has really ticked me off.  The excuse is that tax money shouldn't be used for abortions - well Tax money isn't!</p>

<p>"Planned Parenthood offers medical care and counseling for all things connected to sexual health.
Planned Parenthood is ALREADY FORBIDDEN from using ANY federal funding for abortions. 
Yes, you heard me: Planned Parenthood already DOES NOT USE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR ABORTIONS.
You know what they use federal funding for?
• Five million men, women, and adolescents that get reproductive and sexual health care each year.
• Three million people who visit Planned Parenthood annually for health exams.
• Over one million pap smears.
• 830,000 breast exams.
• Four million tests and treatments for sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV and AIDS.
So what about those abortion services? How much of what Planned Parenthood is about abortion?
THREE PERCENT.</p>

<p>That's how much of what Planned Parenthood does that is related to terminating pregnancies, and does without spending a dime of federal funding in the process." (borrowed from my friend over at   <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/AR08_vFinal.pdf"> of Planned Parenthood</a> .</p>

<p>No one who reads this will have their mind changed.  But if your going to spout something as fact - make sure it is! <br /></p>

<p>Planned Parenthood helped me.  When I was young and broke I was able to get birth control and physicals.  When I was in Australia, it was a easy means for me to get my annual checkup with out dealing with trying to find a doctor in a foreign country.   I've never had an abortion, and I can't imagine every needing one, but I'm grateful that if I needed one, for my health, or back when I was young and foolish, I could have attained one, in a safe environment.</p>

<p>If you live in a glass house and all that….</p>
