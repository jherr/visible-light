	<title>My most successful party ever! – Visible Light</title>
	<meta name="description" content="<p>I hosted a baby shower today … for a very good Friend, Diane.  She's expecting her second, a girl… in a couple of weeks.  Her first, Scottie is one of Megan's favorite "guys" and we love hanging out together.  So I hosted her a baby shower tonight and It all worked out so well… We started at 8 pm, Megan actually was asleep by 7:30.  I made fondue, and all the other ladies brought  a dessert to share (and one mom brought cucumber sandwiches which made a great change).  We had Tiramusu, Cheese cake, Banana Cream pie, Strawberry short cake, and fruit puffs.  It was all so delicious.  I had 5 games prepared thanks to  <a href="http://baby-shower-games-etc.com/baby_shower_games.htm">this site</a> , and I actually picked games no body had played before and everyone.  Different mom's won, and everyone liked the gifts I had.  Everyone had such a good time and I did as well.</p>

<p>I've hosted lots of parties in the past.  Some notable not so successful ones… at least on my part… were Jack's book Launching Picnic (Another group took over our reserved space at the park, which I let get to me and then the awning I bought wouldn't go together easily.  Jack's 35th birthday were I used the worlds smallest grill to cook food for 40 people - way to stressful.  Jack's 30th party was alright but it was alot of people (30 I think) crammed in to a very small space (the company condo we were living in while we were house hunting.)</p>

<p>I've hosted lots of small intimate gatherings, dinner with friends, etc, that I felt were very successful.. but this was my most successful party.</p>
