	<title>Happy New Year! – Visible Light</title>
	<meta name="description" content="<p>Well this year is off to better start.  I didn't start out today in the hospital recovering from surgery like I did last year and today I didn't have any more mishaps like yesterday.  I'm thinking the 3rd thing from yesterday was I destroyed the rug from our bathroom.  I threw it in the wash ( and it disintegrated) before I smashed the baking dish or ran into Jack's car so it was actually the first of 3 bad things.  I just didn't find it till later cause  I was alittle distracted.</p>

I'm thinking the 3rd thing from yesterday was I destroyed the rug from our bathroom.

<p>Today Jack and Megan played at Gymboree while I ran down to Target and bought a new bath matt.  Then we had lunch at this great new sushi place in Fremont.  I then headed to a movie (girl with a pearl earring - which I recommend to any one who likes character films, or period pieces- and of course it had my man Mr Firth so it was great!) while Megan napped and Jack did some work.  It was a great day and then it was topped off by excellent football.  It was a bit of a nail-bitter but the Canes prevailed.</p>

<p>Now lets see if Miami is finally placed above FSU in the damn polls!</p>
